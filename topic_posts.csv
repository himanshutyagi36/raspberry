From one of the book that I have,

First, you need to know where pin 1 is on your DS1820B. Pick the sensor up and youâ€™ll
notice it has two distinct sides. One side is curved and one side is flat with some text on
it. The flat side with the text is the front of the device. When facing the flat side of the
sensor, the pin on the left-hand side is the first. You should check your data sheet as
well, remember them? Your new friends! Go take a look and check the pin out. If you do
manage to insert the DS1820B in the wrong direction, donâ€™t worry it will get really hot but
wonâ€™t blow up. Take it out and let it cool down for some time; keep it still until itâ€™s cool
enough to pick up."," Sat Jan 11, 2014 6:27 am",136,"Tue Aug 27, 2013 1:59 pm","DS18b20 too hot"

Being a welder for decades I am stepping out of my area of knowledge and request some guidance.

I have a small homestead and need 2 rooms very cold for produce and meat. I found 2 items that will do exactly what I need.

The CoolBot and the ColdSnap. One is $300 and the other is open source and about $30. I like $30 a lot better.

I could use the ColdSnap without help because its already laid out in great detail but I need the buttons and LED display of the CoolBot and dont have $600 to get it.

So, My goal is to basically mimic or clone the CoolBot.

If you are unfamiliar with either product let me explain real fast what they do.

You take a regular window air conditioning unit and attach it to one of the mentioned devices. They maintain a temperature thats below the factory minimum of 60 deg F.

There are 4 wires involved.
1) Power
2) Heated diode to fool the A/C units built in air temp sensor to think the air temp is hotter than it is.
3) Temp sensor to monitor the cooling fins to shut it off near 32F so they dont ice up.
4) Air temp sensor that tells the headed diode when to turn on and off.

The buttons let you select C or F, set the minimum air temp and turn the power on or off.

The LED lets you see what you are setting and the current air temp.

Its super simple but beyond me. Like I said the ColdSnap does most of this already but you have to reprogram every change and hook it up to see if its right. I need to be able to adjust the settings for the seasons without taking it apart, into the house, and reprogramming.

Also which would be best suited for this project, Arduino or RaspberyPi?

I am not asking for a how to. I am asking for direction so I can teach myself how to do this. I just dont know where to begin.

Any guidance would be lovely.

I2C addresses are 7 bits. The eighth bit in the ""addressing byte"" specifies read/write.

This read/write bit is the lowest bit. Now, some people say that the address is ""0xC0"" and that to read you need to send ""0xC1"". They mention the WHOLE byte, not just the top 7 bits representing the address. It also means that converting a write-address to a read address is easy: add one.

Others just mention the 7 bits that compose the address. That would be the ""0x60"" used as the DAC address in the source code.

Your use of pv is not going to give a guaranteed delay. It appears to be designed as a pipe monitoring application, but it just happens to have a buffer inside. Compressed video is generally variable bitrate, so the time taken to fill that buffer will vary.

Although implementing this on an AVR would probably require more time and effort than you are willing to spend.
You cant have GPS navigation or graphical LCD on an AVR for example.

What would you recommend as far as the LCD display is concerned? It still might be way too early to think of expansion though.

The most simple choice i guess would be a 2x16 character LCD, which ofcourse cant display everything you want at once.

I am looking for some guidance related to voice controlled home automation. My current task is to control home switches by voice. Something like when I say ""Jiggles, Switch high"" & it turns ON the switch. And when I say ""Jiggles, Lights 75"" & it sets the intensity of LED to 75%.
I have done research & I found that http://www.lightwaverf.com/ sells devices which have wifi link, but I don't want to use it. I want to make possible changes in making a normal switch which can perform the task I want. In short I don't want to use readymade switch, I want to create one. How can I do that ?

Currently what programming I might do is ""done"" by the little gizmo called a PID controller. You give it a target temperature, hook it up to the sensor (mine uses a PT-100) and the relay control side. The 220v wiring to the rice cooker and a 220v cord to plug it all in and that's all. The PID controller has the ""programming"" inside and you never see it.


There isn't much 'programming' to a PID loop, and in fast-moving applications you get 95% of the benefit in the P alone. In slow-moving ones (such as sous-vide, which it seems we are discussing) you get 90% in the P the next 9% of benefit in the I.

The programming you don't get to see is the optimisation of the three magic parameters that go into the PID algorithm. This (the 'tuning') is what uses proprietary approaches / fuzziness / adaptiveness etc.

If you want to implement PID (or PI, or P) controller, the best reference I know of is to start reading at http://brettbeauregard.com/blog/2011/04 ... roduction/ As I understand it, Brett is a professional programmer-of-PID-code. Last I corresponded with him, his employer wouldn't let him talk about tuning (non-disclosure clauses in employment contracts etc) but in all other respects that series of articles is excellent. The code examples are all in Arduino, but it's all explained very clearly. As long as your maths is up to it, implementing it in another language is easy if you follow step-by-step through the articles."," Thu Jan 09, 2014 7:10 am",140,"Wed Feb 13, 2013 6:22 am","TUTORIAL: DS18B20 temp sensor.

  dev = p.get_device_info_by_index(i)

I then went into jasper/client/mic.py and found all instances where it was opening a stream using pyAudio (specifically self._audio.open) and added another parameter such that it was explicitly pointing to my input device (note 2 is the index of my USB microphone above):
CODE: SELECT ALL

                                  input_device_index=2)

Doing this allowed me to get past the ""Invalid Sample Rate"" error, and surfaced a new problem:

will your solar+battery source able to provide power to raspi through the night(especially in winter time?)

if you exclude the solar power part, RBox linux distribution for Raspi could be a ready use solution for you.
At the moment, RBox supports sms send/receive via xmpp connected raspi setup, but USB-3G-Data connectivity is missing, may be in the coming weeks, i would add 3g-data-connectivity to RBox so that Raspi+Huawei_E173 could go online as a stand-alone setup without the ethernet dependency.

but, for the moment, you need to connect Raspi with ethernet for online remote access via xmpp.

I am sorry that it took some while before I could continue with my How-To series around IBM Informix and sensor data on the Raspberry Pi, but from time to time I need to work on some real and exciting sensor data projects for my employer.

Just in case you might have missed my other posts on how to use IBM Informix for sensor data management on the Raspberry Pi, here are those articles:

https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=37&t=97199&p=674959
https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=37&t=97772&p=678497
https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=37&t=100029&p=693935

Today I would like to show you how to configure and how to enable the REST API for Informix. The current developer edition of Informix for the RPi (12.10.UC6DE) includes a Java based REST and MongoDB compliant listener. Although Informix's MongoDB compatibility is a very interesting topic in itself, I am focusing today on the REST API listener alone.

The Informix REST API provides an open, very flexible and secure interface for developers who would like to utilize Informix's sensor (time series) data and relational capabilities without the need to dig too deep into Informix's other client development APIs. The API supports GET, POST, PUT and DELETE operations.

Through the REST API Informix can be also very easily integrated into JavaScript based frameworks like Node.js, Node-RED or any kind of client tools and libraries which support REST calls. As a side note: I am currently working on a simple Informix TimeSeries plugin for Grafana 2.6 (http://grafana.org/). That plugin also utilizes the Informix REST API.

Ok, so let's get started.

Since the Informix REST listener is java based, we need to make sure that we do have a Java JRE or JDK installed on the Raspberry Pi:
CODE: SELECT ALL
sudo apt-get install oracle-java8-jdk

Before we can start the REST listener, we need to define some listener settings in a properties file. The easiest way to do this is to create a copy of the existing listener example file ('$INFORMIXDIR/etc/jsonListener-example.properties') and name it e.g. restListener.properties:
CODE: SELECT ALL
cp $INFORMIXDIR/etc/jsonListener-example.properties $INFORMIXDIR/etc/restListener.properties

Now you need to open the 'restListener.properties' file in an editor of your choice (e.g. vi or nano) and modify a few of the default properties in that file. I am now listing a few properties with values which I am typically using on my Raspberry Pis, but feel free to experiment with those values:
CODE: SELECT ALL
url=jdbc:informix-sqli://localhost:9088/sysmaster:INFORMIXSERVER=ol_informix1210;USER=<your_db_user>;PASSWORD=<your_db_user_password>       # You shouldn't use user informix credentials here, if your REST listener is accessible from outside the Raspberry Pi due to potential security issues!
listener.hostName=*
database.share.close.enable=true
listener.idle.timeout=3000
listener.port=<your desired port number for the REST API eg. 8080>
listener.http.accessControlAllowOrigin=""*""
listener.type=rest
pool.size.maximum=2
pool.connections.maximum=4
pool.type=advanced
response.documents.count.default=10000     # or any desired number
pool.idle.timeout=60
security.sql.passthrough=true   # only set this property to true if you would like to use the SQL pass through feature!

As soon as you have modified your REST listener properties, you can start the REST listener with the following command:
CODE: SELECT ALL
java -cp $INFORMIXDIR/bin/jsonListener.jar com.ibm.nosql.server.ListenerCLI -config $INFORMIXDIR/etc/restListener.properties -logfile $INFORMIXDIR/tmp/restListener.log -loglevel error -start

If you would like to start the REST listener in the background you could e.g. do the following:
CODE: SELECT ALL
nohup java -cp $INFORMIXDIR/bin/jsonListener.jar com.ibm.nosql.server.ListenerCLI -config $INFORMIXDIR/etc/restListener.properties -logfile $INFORMIXDIR/tmp/restListener.log -loglevel error -start &> /dev/null &

As soon as the listener is up and running, you can execute some simple REST GET operations against your sensor data through a web browser which is able to connect to the Informix REST listener port on the Raspberry Pi. In the following examples I assume that the 'listener.port' property has been set to '8080'. Also: in my examples I am using 'localhost' as the hostname. Please adjust that value to your specific Raspberry Pi hostname or IP address.

With the following example URL I am fetching all time series data from the VTI table 'sensor_data':
CODE: SELECT ALL
http://localhost:8080/sensor_db/sensor_data

Now limit the result set to only one primary key (one time series) with the following URL:
CODE: SELECT ALL
http://localhost:8080/sensor_db/sensor_data?query={""sensor_id"":""Sensor01""}

If you only want to retrieve specific columns from your VTI table (or any other relational table in Informix), just use the fields operator:
CODE: SELECT ALL
http://localhost:8080/sensor_db/sensor_data?query={""sensor_id"":""Sensor01""}&fields={""timestamp"":1,""value"":1}

BTW, time stamps returned are epoch time stamps (milliseconds since 01/01/1970) in UTC.
Ok now let's provide a slightly more complex query through the REST API by providing a time stamp range:
CODE: SELECT ALL
http://localhost:8080/sensor_db/sensor_data?query={""$and"": [{""sensor_id"":""Sensor01""},{""timestamp"":{""$gte"": {""$date"":1289347200000}}},{""timestamp"":{""$lt"": {""$date"":1297122300000}}} ]}&fields={""timestamp"":1,""value"":1}

Alternatively to the numeric representation of the epoch time stamps in the query conditions, you can also use the following JSON time stamp string format:
CODE: SELECT ALL
http://localhost:8080/sensor_db/sensor_data?query={""$and"": [{""sensor_id"":""Sensor01""},{""timestamp"":{""$gte"": {""$date"":""2016-02-24T15:00:00.000Z""}}},{""timestamp"":{""$lt"": {""$date"":""2016-02-24T15:30:00.000Z""}}} ]}&fields={""timestamp"":1,""value"":1}


The SQL pass-through support in the Informix REST listener
If you have set the listener property 'security.sql.passthrough=true' (again, be careful in doing so!), you can send any SQL command to the Informix database. In the following example I am sending a SELECT statement through the REST API to Informix which returns the last entry of a time series:
CODE: SELECT ALL
http://localhost:8080/sensor_dbsystem.sql?query={""$sql"":""select GetLastElem(sensor_values).value from sensor_ts where sensor_id = 'Sensor01'""}


BTW that Informix built-in time series function 'GetLastElem()' can be quite handy if you would like to display/visualize the most recent stored sensor data value.

I think by now you should hopefully have enough information to get you started with the Informix REST API.

Since Informix's REST API is much more powerful than I could have described in such a short introductionary article, I would recommend that you take a look at the following online documentation:

REST API Syntax: https://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSGU8G_12.1.0/com.ibm.json.doc/ids_json_051.htm
REST API and time series data queries: https://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSGU8G_12.1.0/com.ibm.json.doc/ids_json_065.htm
General information about the Informix listener: https://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSGU8G_12.1.0/com.ibm.json.doc/ids_json_004.htm
In addition to the online documentation there are also some helpful presentations available on slide share:

http://www.slideshare.net/IBM_Info_Management/developing-hybrid-applications-with-informix
http://www.slideshare.net/IBM_Info_Management/informix-on-arm-and-informix-timeseries-producing-an-internetofthings-solution

Informix TimeSeries Node-RED nodes
Since I briefly mentioned Node-RED in the intro of this post, let me also point you to a set of Informix Node-RED time series nodes which utilize the Informix REST API:
http://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-contrib-timeseries

I am using those nodes quite often on my Raspberry Pi to pre-aggregate sensor data before they are sent into the cloud.

And finally: have fun using the Informix REST API in combination with the Informix time series capabilities!

Actually the current driving capabilities of PI2 GPIO pins is limited to few miliamps. So the current sourcing capabilities of GPIO pins is very low. So you need to go for Motor Driver ICs which isolates the GPIO pins from current driving capabilities and back feeding emfs generated during motor start and stop conditions.

http://www.irf.com/product-info/datashe ... rf7507.pdf


The Vgs is fine, a lower threshold (meaning closer to 0 since for the p channel part it's negative) isn't normally a problem.

I would make sure R2 isn't too large, I think the Pi has internal pullups on the GPIO pins, these are normally in the 100kohm region (I've not looked at the ones on the Pi specifically). You want to ensure that any voltage divider formed by the internal pullup and R2 gives a voltage that is below the threshold so that Q1 is always in a known state if the circuits input is not being actively driven. In other words you will probably want to keep it under 10k.

The only potential issue is the Rds on for the P channel part is a little higher than I'd like (max of 0.27 ohms for a Gate-Source voltage you'd end up with). That means that with the display taking 0.4A you could be dropping up to 0.1V in the transistor, not enough to matter but more than ideal.
This is mainly me being excessively fussy, that part should work fine."," Wed Sep 26, 2012 3:01 pm",31,"Mon Sep 17, 2012 11:02 am","Modifying a 3.5"" car display for USB power."

Hi,
following this tutorial I was able to compile Chocolate Doom on my rPi.

Chocolate Doom allows multiplayer on a dedicated server, so... do you think the RPI can be a good dedicated server for Chocolate Doom? What about performances?

Thank you very much!


Greetings fellow Raspbian,
I really haven't tried running a dedicated server on this game but I read in a forum of another game called Quake3 that there are no servers compatible on the Pi when you want to play multiplayer, unless you make the server for others to join. I think the same applies here. I only know how to make a dedicated server on Quake3 and I'm not sure if it is the same way here. A good wifi connection is also a part to have a better performance. Before you ever make a server for others to join, though, try to play single player first or fill your server with bots and test if the Pi can handle it.

Apologies if I get really messy when I explain , so to recap:
- It is hard to find a compatible server on the Pi, so when you want to play multiplayer,
- You can run your own dedicated server (I base all this on my knowledge on Quake3, I hope you know how to run a dedicated one or you can ask me how it goes on the game Quake and see if it works in this game, too)
- You can also test the performance (But I'm sure the Pi can handle until 8 players)

So I just got my EdiMax wifi nano usb adapter which I would like to take apart and solder the board onto my Pi Zero.

It talks about how the initial surge, caused by using a cheap power supply might kill the wifi board. I was considering putting in something like say.. a 10 ohm resistor between one of the pads and wifi module. That way, roughly 400-500ma could flow to the module(hopefully thats not too much) and might assist in keeping it from frying.

Could this work? I might just choose to go the powered hub method for usb my problems.. It would just be nice to have the compactness of a zero with wifi for those small internet controllable projects.

anita2r,https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=47553,"Hi,

To start you off:

Your temperature sensor is a variable resistor.
Connect 5 volts to one end of it and connect the other end to 0 volts (ground) through a fixed resistance.

The point at which the temperature sensor and the fixed resistor join will have a voltage that varies with temperature.
The range of voltage will depend on the temperature sensor's resistance at the maximum possible and minimum possible temperatures, and the value of your fixed resistance.

So you need to know (from a data sheet or by measuring it) what the maximum and minimum resistance will be.

Knowing this you can use ohms law and calculate the value of your fixed resistance so that the voltage at the junction of the sensor and the fixed resistance does not exceed 3.3 volts.

You then use an analogue to digital converter (ADC) chip to read the voltage at this junction and output a digital value which the Pi can interpret.

There are plenty of posts about using an ADC with the Pi. The MCP3204 chip (used in single ended mode) will convert your voltages and provide digital values. The MCP3204 is a suitable ADC and can be connected to the Pi using the SPI interface. The MCP3204 can measure up to 4 variable voltage inputs.

Various programs are available for reading data from the SPI interface.
You will then have to create either a table or an algorithm to convert the digital values to actual temperatures.
The MCP 3204 outputs a digital value between 0 and 4096.
As the MCP3204 requires a 'reference' voltage, if the measured voltage equals the reference voltage, the value will be 4096. If the measured voltage is zero volts, then the value will be zero.

Using a reference voltage of 3.3 volts supplied to the MCP3204:
if the point between the sensor resistor and the fixed resistor has a voltage of 1.65 (half of 3.3), then the MPC3204 will output a value of 2048 (half of 4096). If that mid point had a voltage of 3.3 volts (remember the maximum specified earlier), then the MCP would send a value of 4096 out to the Pi along the SPI interface.

CODE: SELECT ALL
Supply  sensor R         fixed R    ground
 5V -----/\/\/\-----o-----/\/\/\----- 0V

More specifically our project owner wish to be able to open and close his chicken coop door from his phone. It would be a plus if he could also set a temperature or time or brightness level to control the door.

In addition, he wish to have his fifteen hens counted, meaning how many hens are inside and how many are outside. This knowledge is also important since the door can't close if there are still hens outside.

I wonder if an raspberry is a good choice for controlling the chicken coop (We have had it suggested to us)? I would also appreciate it if you could assess the difficulty of the project or share some of your ideas on how to accomplish our goal. All of our project members have VERY limited programming experience.

Thank you very much!

Arkinto,https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=186019,"Hi all

So I have been developing a full scale robotic arm that replicates your movements via sensors your wear. I have decided I may be able to change to a raspberry pi, I was using an Arduino mega which turns out may not be powerful enough. I'm sending and receiving 3 sets of IMU data and moving steppers (each controlled at 0.0005 seconds or 500 microsecond delays for movement) as well as all the servo's moving at once (basically)
I need one pi to read 3 IMU sensors and 5 slide potentiometers, this pi must also filter the IMU sensor data (which is where the Arduino fell short) and then send these values to another pi.
The second pi controls 6 servo's, a dc motor and 2 stepper motors. It reads the values sent from the other pi and moves the motors accordingly. This second pi must also send back potentiometer values for 3 of the motors (this acts as a feedback loop for knowing motor position).
Is this feasible? I have been talking to some people and they have serious doubts about the pi being able to do this level of real-time hardware operating! This arm operates in real time, copying your movements exactly. I also have all hardware for the pi and the design under control, so no need to help me on that I think (using pwm hat's and analog to digital chips etc)

Also is there a way to not have to use Linux and instead make it operate similar to an Arduino?
I have also been looking at the OS below:

Would it be better to stick with the Arduino mega or switch to a pi?

I am new to these forums and the Raspberry Pi as I am sure you can tell. I am however, very interested in investigating and seeking help with a project I intend to use the Raspberry Pi for.

Backstory: I have a server room in a remote location not easily accessible where I house a DAS unit. This unit needs to be switched on and off when needed at various times during the week via a push button on the front of the unit. Because of the location of the unit, I am unable to access it to turn on when needed and to switch off when finished accessing the data on the DAS.

Possible solution: I would therefore, like to utilise the Raspberry Pi to control a servo mounted to the front of the unit to actuate the physical switch. I would like to be able to control the servo through a web interface so that I am able to remotely actuate the switch over my local network. I would also require feedback that the unit has been successfully turned on, therefore, I would like to implement an LDR on the status light of my DAS so that I receive feedback through the web interface that the unit is either on or off.

I have very little experience with the Pi and I am not even sure if this project is possible. I would however, really appreciate an thoughts, comments or help with the project that anyone has to offer as well as any suggestions about setup. I also don't have any idea with how I would begin to write the code to control the Pi and Servo.

Phidgets has a nice assortment of enviromental sensors including a low cost pH probe for $24.

pH probes(as well as oxygen probes) put out a mV range signal so you would need to build an instrument amplifier circuit or buy an adapter ($30-Phidgets).
I have a koi pond oxygen sensor with an attached meter which I bought for about $120, so it stand to reason the sensor by itself should be less. The probe isn't intended for continuous monitoring. The documentation implies that it can get easily fouled. So, you need to research that.

""Hello, thanks for your purchase! VOUT is proportional to the amount of reflected energy so you'll have to experiment. As for the FREQ_OUT ouput, I invite you to have a look at the application note.""

Would it make sense to connect the VOUT, rated at 2.5V->VCC to a GPIO18 (for example) and the Frequency out to GPIO17.
I want to achieve to read the VOUT (the amount of reflected energy, perhaps this can be used to detect if it 's a car or bicycle?)
and the Frequency Out to detect the velocity / speed.

You should connect the shield at the best earth connection you can find at one end of the cable. It doesn't matter which end and you are more likely to find one on the gaz meter end because generally Pi power supplies are isolated from the mains earth.

Sheilding is a dark art -- there are no perfect rules -- but this one is pretty good. If you manage to earth it at both ends you can end up with worse interference than if you didn't bother.

So, I should be connecting only one end.

We got the sensors and oled display working over the last several weekends, this weekend we were checking out the robot kit part of the project and found the motors were not performing as well as we had hoped, especially at low speeds. We did some googling on what PWM frequency we should be using to control the motors and didn't come up with much info after spending a full hour. We (mostly me) ended up writing a quick perl program to program the pwm duty cycle and collect the data....

Our setup : Raspberry Pi B+, pigpiod (excellent software!), USB 0.5A charger w/motors powered from gpio, as well the the kit and h bridge mentioned above. Data was collected over a range of PWM frequencies with the duty cycle changed in about 2% increments. One curve set was taken with the motor free-wheeling and another with an additional load torque of about 3oz-in (wheel skidding on desktop into a scale measuring about two ounces).

My conclusion - The 20Hz PWM rate does seem to be a good operational point for slow speeds and decent torque, at slightly higher speeds or a longer required operational life I would probably looking at 50Hz.

Percona have a script in their tool kit to sync tables between mysql servers. It could be a good option if you're running mysql on the pi also. http://www.percona.com/doc/percona-tool ... -sync.html

When implementing a servomotor, which is what a PID loop controlling a motor is,
you are wise to avoid using slow decay mode, and ensuring the PWM frequency
is high enough.

The best set up is to use synchronous rectification (like fast decay except
the bridge is always driven, PWM reverses the direction, so that 50% PWM = stationary,
0% is backwards, 100% is forwards). This mode is lossier (magnetic losses
in the motor), but better behaved at stationary (which is what you want for balance).

Because of the need for relatively high PWM frequency you may find the L298 is
just too slow. A MOSFET bridge may proof more capable. However it all depends
on the motor and how loaded it is.

I have successfully coded a program in python to read temperature data from a BS18B20 1 wire sensor and log it in a daily email to give me an overview of temperature changes.

My next move is to make this program run at startup, however I have hit a stumbling block. I have to issue the following after each reboot to allow the program to read the sensor.

sudo modprobe w1-gpio
sudo modprobe w1-therm


Is there a way this can be automatically issued on startup, allowing full automation of my project?

Hardware that should be add:
-barometric Sensor
-5x Ultrasonic Rangesensor
- maybe new Radio system with Xbee Pro

The Software is mostly written by my own and so most Parameter (like PID) are not compareable to other Quadrotors.

The Software reads the Sensordata with 300hz-500hz and controls the Motors with 50hz.
Most of the time the Software waits for Sensordata because IÂ²C is ""slow"". The actual computation takes barely no time (everything with floating point Numbers).

Hi

Just wanted to give kudos for your project. I've been designing something similar for the last few weeks which is how I came across your project.

One thing I'm not sure about if you don't mind. As you said, the board has a 5V output solder point but I can't work out how the wiring with the voltage regulator is working (I'm a complete electronics novice so please forgive the stupid questions below) in that configuration...

I can see you've wired it to the 12V input, but isn't the board itself still receiving (unregulated) power via it's standard wiring even with the VR soldered on ? Likewise, isn't the 5V output point receiving (unregulated) power through the board despite soldering the VR output to it?

Thanks in advance!


Hi Slikvik,
I'm not entirely sure I understand, I'll try to describe the connections.
I disconnect the centre pin of the power in socket, from the M.NT68676.2A board.
I then connect the center pin from that socket, positive, to the positive of the seperate voltage regulator board.
I connect the positive output from the seperate voltage regulator back to where the center pin was connected on the M.NT68676.2A board.
I also connect the 0V (ground) of the M.NT68676.2A board to the 0v (ground) of the seperate voltage regulator board.
The regulator board I have already set up to output 9V, this should now power the LCD and the M.NT68676.2A board, from any DC input in the range 11 to 40V.
So to recap, the M.NT68676.2A power socket positive now connects to the seperate regulator, that regulator now powers the M.NT68676.2A at 9V.
The M.NT68676.2A board has it's own built in 5V regulator, which can suppy about 2A of power.
I connect that 5V output to the Pi to power it. (see photo of the post just above yours)
Be very carefull, if you short anything out, or connect it the wrong way round, you'll almost certaily damage something.
Hope this helps.

The ultimate goal behind HEW was to make my own robot from scratch that was usable, i.e. it had a good working range, could pick up objects and was easy to build. But along the way i through many other people would quite like this as well. So i started to play round with some different ideas such as customers choice, like different colours, grippers, mobility and power options. Hence why i am here. I'd like to show you HEW to see what you think and what your feedback is.

Does he look good, do you like his working range, the colour options? What are your thoughts?

So what can he do? Well that's entirely up to you really, however I have some examples of how i've used HEW so far; to make a cup of tea, play chess, play a guitar, a keyboard, pick and place objects, pass us tools, hand out cards and controlled him using a USB controller it's all really fun stuff.

How do you control him? Controlling servos is quite simple, most servo motors use a standard PWM control method where 1mS (1 milliSecond) sets the position to 0 degrees, upto 2.5mS sets the position to 180 degrees with control of anywhere in between. Most micro-controllers (Dev-boards) such as the BBC Micro-bit, Mbed or Arduino have standard PWM outputs, platforms such as the Raspberry Pi have easy to use libraries which enable you to use GPIO for PWM outputs.

From this we found that HEW isn't just good for makers and programmers, schools & colleges could use him to create really innovative and interactive programming lessons which would be fun and not to mention cool! but also for use in other STEM subjects. Universities and students could use him for rapid & easy prototyping or for use in their final year project, and for the maker/hacker for making all sorts of awesome and cool projects.

I hope you like the idea and HEW himself. Please tells us what you think.

Ultimately if you'd like one your self we've started a kickstarter campaign which you can find here: http://kck.st/1QhyA4C , Here you will find lots more detail into the technical side and how I designed him. back us today and get your very own desktop robot.

New to the raspberry pi, and it's been years since I've built any customized system like this, but having a blast learning it all!

The project we are undertaking is one that I see a few online have tackled - vehicle speed detection and image capture using the pi. The device will be installed on a corner post and sense the incoming vehicle, capturing video and hopefully a clear shot of the license plate. These are stop sign intersections, so we shouldn't be dealing with very high speeds, even if someone does run the stop sign.

Several have posted where they use Motion to detect the vehicle with image processing, but we are hoping to minimize the power requirements by switching the pi camera on and off only when a vehicle approaches. The plan is to capture video in both directions using 2 pi cams and a multiplexer board.

The sensor that seems to make the most sense is the HB100 doppler sensor. Still debating whether to use a single sensor, or two of them pointing in opposite directions as we would like to be as precise as possible. The sensors were easy to find, and very inexpensive, but now we see why - they do require additional circuitry before feeding the output signal into the pi.

I was hoping to find a sensor that already has the circuitry to simply plug it in to the GPIO, but the only ones I found were these:

https://www.tindie.com/products/limpkin ... ackpack-1/

http://www.sunrom.com/212

Both are outside the US, and I was hoping to source locally. Does anyone know of a similar sensor sold in the US?

We have not got too far with testing other than running some sample captures with Motion, but I was curious also about the ability to switch cameras off and on as needed:

1) Can it be done via a Python command?
2) If so, how long before the camera is ready to start recording


Thanks to all in advance,

http://42bots.com/tutorials/stepper-motor-wiring-how-to/
Now that we have determined which wires belong to each coil, how do we determine the proper stepper polarity? No way to do that with a multimeter, unfortunatelyâ€¦Connect the motor to your motor driver of choice. Connect power and run the code to spin the motor clockwise. If the motor spins in the expected direction, you have the correct polarity. If it spins in reverse, you need to switch the polarity of one of the two pairs (it does not matter which one).

So the connection polarity does matter but only in that it will cause the motor to turn the wrong way.

yodermk wrote:
- It looks like you have a choice between using the ""bus"" slots or the rather longer series of slots for controlling the motors, but not both? If I use the bus, I'd connect all six of those to GPIO pins (do I need resistors?) ... then set one or more ENx pins high to control that motor, set the DIR high or low to set the direction, then send a brief pulse to STP to make a move. (?)


As I read it, the ""Bus"" connection would cause all of the drivers to step simultaneously, so if any one driver gets a step command they will all step together.

Without the bus terminals connected each stepper driver can be commanded individually (but not simultaneously).

Similarly, the direction selection can either be individual or as a Bus.

Recently i discovered Mopidy https://www.mopidy.com/ and now its just annoying me even more because essentially what i want is your clock, weather app, mopidy integrated in a screen, and a google calendar with reminders.. Also it needs to run GPIO for the LED strip that will be the ""Sunrise alarm"" part of it all.

For example:

This guy.. kind of did exactly what I'm after.. with the exception of Spotify integration. However when i tried to run it last night on my windows rig and raspberry pi machine.. I was spat out with an error about gdata.calender.client
""Module not found"" from python.. I can't find any information on how Google APIs work.. but I'm fairly certain its
something i need to know.

And of course.. Project seems to be disbanded. Can't seem to get in touch with the developer.

Ha! You're even more crazy than me. My idea was just to make a python script that would open that webpage with the touch of an icon..Not to develop an entire app for it.

Although similar sounds to that (eg: the birds chirping) would be what i would be after for my sunrise alarm sounds.

I am looking for a good Solid State Relay kit/module to switch on and of an amplifier and some other external equipment.
I read a lot about the Sainsmart modules. But they seem to have some drawbacks. The biggest ones is that to switch them on, the GPIO signal should be 0, i.e. inverted. This means that most of the time, the GPI must be high and therefore will draw current.
Also if the Pi fails for some reason and looses power, the amp will switch on.
Many forums advice to buffer the module with a transistor in front.

I would like to have a single module that has it all, so good buffering, non inverted and sufficient capacity to switch a 100-200 W 230VAC device. An added bonus would be a 2 or 4 channel kit.
Soldering is not a problem, but creating my own PCB would be a minus:-(

Today I wanted to introduce my first project: Iunctio (latin for connect).
When I first got my raspberry pi I had a really hard time setting it up as a cheap NAS server. I found different solutions online but I could never find the best setup. After weeks of searching I finally found the fast and simple configuration I was looking for:

- Rtorrent as torrent server
- Rutorrent as web interface for rutorrent with RSS plugin
- NFS file sharing server
- Nginx as webserver
- OS base: Arch Linux ARM

However even if I knew exactly what I wanted to do, it was really hard to look up how to configure all of those different services since a lot of guide were outdated and some problems werenâ€™t solved yet, and so it took me at least one month to configure everything the way I wanted.

After being a happy user of that setup for 1 year I decided that I didn't want anybody to go through the struggle I had to go through and even if my programming skills are extremely low I created the Iunctio Project.

The project even if fully functional is still a concept, its base is only constructed around two bash scripts and various configuration files.
The first script is the flash script, it downloads the latest Arch Linux ARM release, installs various dependencies required for the setup and flashes the latest configuration files from github.
The second script it's ran through SSH or directly by connecting the RPI to an HDMI monitor and it configures the different services for the most common usages.

Once the second script has finished executing without errors after a reboot the RPI should start working right away.

Unfortunately, since I'm still a high schooler, my programming skills and my network knowledge are very low and there are tons of bugs that need to be fixed. However I hope the community will be able to help me learn and improve my project bit by bit, and who knows something big might actually come out of this.

If you want to test my project you are more than welcome to do so!
Download the script for your architecture from here: https://github.com/BrozzSama/iunctio/tr ... er/scripts and run it as root! Remember that rsync and parted must be installed on your system and that if you're not flashing from an ARM computer you also require the qemu binaries.
After that SSH into your rpi (or connect it to an HDMI monitor), login with
CODE: SELECT ALL
user: root
password: root

and run
CODE: SELECT ALL
â€œiunctiosetupâ€

The process is completely interactive and everything should be up and running in no time!

For the best experience you can also buy or build an ODROID-SHOW and get download/upload speed with a glance:

There are several things you could do to improve your noise level issues by processing the incoming audio before it's sent to the Pi for recording.

Firstly make sure you have a good quality microphone and one sold as noise cancelling or uni-directional pick up they suppress noise better than traditional omnidirectional or cardioid.
Next you'll need a microphone pre-amp circuit with band-pass filtering to remove low frequency and high frequencies while faithfully maintaining the human voice with less background noise.
And finally a noise gate / expander circuit this adds more dynamics to loudness vs quietness of audio so background noise levels roll off faster or are totally eliminated.

Steppers have resolution. More resolution = more $. A stepper with one degree of resolution driving through a gear ratio of 10:1 would have 1/10 degree resolution. Maybe 50:1 or 100:1 would be better especially since in your case slower is better.

You should also consider torque. Especially if this will be G scale. The slower gear ratio would also multiply torque. Haven't really thought about this in practical terms yet. Would guess some drag is inevitable.

Most motors when turned become generators so some protection or isolation might be a good idea. The gear ratio going the other way would really spin the motor.

However I find the Arduino seems complicated and the Pi seems a bit more friendly so I have had renewed interest.

I was thinking what you want is for the robot to use ultrasonic/IR sensors and basically draw and approximate map of the area by reading distances of stuff at 0.5degree intervals. The idea being is the robot could work out roughly the size of each room/area and where the 'middle' is.

based on the 'map' of each room you wouldnt need to exactly use gps as it could tell by distance how far it was away from say a docking station or something.

At least thats the way I have been thinking about it. My problem is I dont know coding well enough to begin, but I do have some ideas on how a bot could record information.

For my bot I was looking at also having height sensors so it would know if it was under something (lets say a bench in the garden) and with enough sensors it could detect rain and go and hide under the bench or table. Equally in a house you might find it useful so you dont trip over the robot (if someones not paying attention) it could scurry under a chair/table to be out of feets way.

There is no home position with a model servo. Its position is determined solely by the mark-space ratio of the PWM signal fed to its PWM input pin. It stays exactly where you left it if you take the drive signal away or power down the servo.
can you turn servos really slowly? it'd be nice if the operation looked realistic.

You can turn them as slowly as you like. You could even build acceleration/deceleration curves into your software if you like to simulate the inertia of a heavy real-world turntable.

For the benefit of anyone else trying this, I have added a photo, showing one optocoupler wired up to my controller.
This is what I have found out.
It is not obvious from the datasheet of the 4N25 which way round it goes.

I found out by trial and error that, holding the 4N25 with the writing the correct way up, the top row, L to R, is Base, Collector, Emitter. My device is using the orange and yellow wires, connected to C and E. As my colleagues said, it is a 50/50 guess which way round these go. Don't forget this fact, if it doesn't work first time.

The bottom row is then Anode, Cathode and erm, NC. I have connected GPIO pin 17 using a red wire through a resistor to the anode, cathode to ground on the Pi (black wire) and that's it.

CarlRJ,https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=101632,"Hmm, I said it was Plexiglas, but I'm thinking now that what I used may have been Polycarbonate. In any case, it was a rigid (as in, you can flex it some, but it's not floppy) clear plastic sheet, that was about 1/16th of an inch thick (around 1.5mm). I got an 8x10-inch sheet for something under 5 dollars at the local Home Depot hardware store. It was designed to be used as a less breakable replacement for glass in picture frames (that's why it's available in small picture-sized sheets). Probably a lot of different materials would work just as well, this is just what I ended up with. The important thing is, 1) not floppy, and 2) really thin - if it's thick, the screen will appear to be set down/back inside the case, rather than being out front and center - and it will make pressing near the edges of the touchscreen difficult.

The plastic can be ""scored"" with a ""plastic scoring tool"" and then snapped along the score line using a straight-edge (much the way one would cut glass). I know I did some of the work with a Dremel tool, but I don't recall how much of each method I used (but even a small sheet like this would make numerous Pi front plates, so it's safe to experiment).

Anyway, I built up the Pibow case around the Pi and PiTFT, then laid some paper over the front/top and gently pressed around on it to make an impression of the shape required (rectangle that matches the size/shape of the Pibow layer rectangles, plus the rectangular cutout for the screen, small ones for the buttons, and the holes in the corners that the screws go through).

Then I used the paper to mark out the same pattern on the plastic sheet, cut the main outer rectangle (pretty sure that was using the plastic scoring tool method), then used the Dremel to cut out the holes for the screen and buttons, and drilled holes in the corners to match the screw holes in the Pibow layers (good idea to drill the screw holes early on - makes test fittings easier and more accurate, and if you go to all the work to get the rectangular screen cutout perfect and then mess up the screw holes, you'll be very sad). My result looks good from a distance, but if you get up close it's clear I could have done a better second try. There was also some filing on the outer edge, the edges of the cutout for the screen, and holes for the buttons, and the four outer corners (to match the radius of the Pibow's edges), plus some filing and sanding just to smooth all the edges off. I did a bunch of test fittings on the Pi along the way (make sure to wipe off the plate before fitting onto the Pi, so you don't get plastic shavings into the Pibow or Pi). Then, once it fit acceptably well, I painted one side of the part (I chose to paint the side facing into the case, so the paint couldn't be easily scratched off once assembled). The important thing here is, you need to use a paint that is designed for use on plastic. Normal spray paint doesn't get along well with plastic. I used ""Fusion for Plastic"" spray paint from Krylon.

It was all sort of an experiment where the first try came out ""good enough"", so that I went on to other projects, but I wouldn't call it my best work."," Mon Apr 18, 2016 11:28 pm",34,"Wed Feb 19, 2014 9:00 pm","Is there an enclosure that works with 2.8"" TF"

I want to set up a way of connecting to a WiFi network for a headless pi robot. I currently control the robot through a little node.js based website over my home network. The problem is that I cannot then control it when I am not at home. My idea is for the pi to boot up and start the node.js server. If it detects that it doesn't have an internet connection then it will use a DHCP server to emit WiFi. Then I will be able to use my phone to connect to the pi's network and give the SSID and password of a nearby WiFi network with internet. Then the pi will turn off the DHCP server and try to connect to the network. If it still doesn't have an internet connection, then it will start up the DHPC server again.
Untitled Diagram.png (31.96 KiB) Viewed 117 times

I'm planning to use node.js to output on a 16x2 LCD screen the status of the network. E.g. ""Connect to 'PiWiFi' network to configure"" or ""My IP address is currently '192.168.0.99' on the network 'HomeNetwork1'"". So that I can tell what the pi is up to.

Am I over complicating things? If not, will I be able to get a DHCP server to work like this?

I've bought a rain detector: simply a PCB with traces which will short when in contact with a conductive material (water). I can interface to the RPi and it will send me an email telling me to bring my washing in off the line.

However nice such a facility is, it is overkill. I don't need the RPi tied up to providing this facility. What I have thought about doing is re-purposing a cheap wireless door chime. If I could activate the push switch (by shorting the contacts), this would activate the reciever and sound an alarm. The RPi can be used for better things.

However, my question is about how to connect circuits of different power supplies without using serial/parallel interfacing: i.e. a simple electrical contact activation. The door chime remote uses a 12v supply, the rain detector (or Pi if I still chose to use it) uses 3.3v or 5v. I'm guessing I can't simply provide current from one power source and input into a separate circuit with a differing power source and expect everything to work. Even if they were operating at similar voltage levels, would this be possible by simply injecting a current into the correct side of the push switch contact if they were from different power supplies?

I guess this is not dissimilar to projects involving activation of remote controlled power sockets. Must I use an opto-isolater? If I simply gave them a common ground would this work?

today my RasPi3 arrived and I'm planning on putting it in my car.
First idea was to add a GPS module so it could track its movements.
Also I'd like to locate my car (e.g. ""where the hell did I park again?"") which would require some kind of GSM-module with a internet-enabled SIM-card.

Luckily projects like this have been done before so I already found some tutorials and modules.
However I am quite confused about the prices (and priceranges) of said modules.
I am used to $1-modules from china which completely suffice and do their job.
Now looking for a GSM and GPS module I easily get above $50 and some shops even want triple.
Specifically I came across SIM900 and similar.

Is it just the specific technology which makes these things so expensive?
Are there low-budget alternatives?
I already didn't like having to buy a SIM-card for $5/month for the internet, so yeah I'm pretty stingy.

Maybe you got some different ideas on how to locate a raspberry pi which might be anywhere (let's say within the country).
I thought about just buying a GPS-module until I know more about GSM however some modules are able to do both and are cheaper than two seperate modules. I couldn't locate my car but synchronize the data once I'm home.

I have 2 of them installed in our heating system measuring the temperature of hot water. The water can be anywhere from ~130Â°F up to boiling, but usually stays under 200Â°F.

After installing them, they worked fine for a few months and then the whole pi shut down. It turned out that the sensor itself was shorting out the power and ground pins on the GPIO. I replaced the sensor and now a couple months later it has happened again. (not sure if the one I replaced failed again or if its the other one.)

Adafruit sells this high temp version that has the same sensor in it but the wiring is different https://www.adafruit.com/product/642 but their normal once says it works up to 100Â°C so I would think the high temp version would not be needed for my use case.

One to be held and to display the time

So the question here is what is the best way to make these 3 rPi's talk to each other over these distances, with out any delay to get good accuracy for the times??? xBEE, NRF24L01 etc????

Combinationofthis,https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=187042,"Hello,

I`m building robot for my uni diploma work and I`m using Raspberry pi 2 as my robots controller.
I need to connect AXIS IP camera to raspberry via Ethernet port to view live video, but at the same time I need to be connected to the raspberry via ethernet cable as well (raspberry to laptop).
So I need two Ethernet ports. I have bought Ethernet to USB adapter to connect my camera.
The problem is that when I connect both devices (IP camera and laptop) to raspberry only one actually gets connected.
Example:

1. When I connect laptop to main ethernet port I can ssh to raspberry whith no problem. At the same time my IP camera would be connected to usb to ethernet adapter that is connected to pi. Raspberry shows that second port is connected, but I can not access camera live streaming.
2. When I connect IP camera to main ethernet port I can access camera live streaming via raspberry browser. At the same time my laptop is connected to usb to ethernet adapter and I can not ssh to raspberry.

I know that my usb to ethernet adapter is working with pi because when I only connect laptop with that adapter I can ssh to raspberry without any problems.

My robot is meant to work in a following way: run node.js server on raspberry. Node server connects to camera only to get data from camera and passes it to node client via socket.io. Node server client is my laptop that is connected to raspberry via ethernet cable.

Notes:
Axis Ip camera has static IP aadress and when connected only returns video stream. That IP camera is like as server that raspberry node server has to connect.
I have set static IP aadress to raspberry as well.

How can I accomplish this? Can raspberry receive data from one server via usb to ethernet adapter and host my laptop via main ethernet port?

An IV curve plots the current and voltage generated by a PV panel for different load resistances ranging from short circuit to open circuit. The point on this curve that has the largest I*V product is the maximum power point (MPP). The shape of the IV curve and the MPP for a PV panel depend on factors such as its temperature and the intensity and uniformity of the sunlight falling on its surface. Understanding IV curves for PV panels is an important part of learning about the technology.

The IV Swinger consists of a bank of loads and relays to select whether each load is included in the circuit or bypassed. It has an ammeter and voltmeter to measure the current and voltage at each point. Python code running on a Raspberry Pi controls the sequencing, takes the measurements, and generates the IV curve graphs.

The IV Swinger was used in the Spring 2015 and 2016 CEE176B labs. It was also used by the Stanford Solar Car project in 2015. I have posted detailed design documentation and all of the software on GitHub. There are also several videos posted on YouTube.

Written in an easy-to-follow conversational manner, it will show you how to build your own sophisticated modular home security system using the Raspberry Pi. This is my first book, so I look forward to your comments, good or bad, and answering any further questions you may have about its content.

Read a sample of the book here: http://bit.ly/1UmbLer
ISBN: 9781782175278



About This Book
* This book guides you through building a complete home security system with Raspberry Pi and helps you remotely access it from a mobile device over the Internet
* It covers the fundamentals of interfacing sensors and cameras with the Raspberry Pi so that you can connect it to the outside world
* It follows a modular approach so that you can choose the modules and features you want for your customized home security system

Who This Book Is For
This book is for anyone who is interested in building a modular home security system from scratch using a Raspberry Pi board, basic electronics, sensors, and simple scripts. This book is ideal for enthusiastic novice programmers, electronics hobbyists, and engineering professionals. It would be great if you have some basic soldering skills in order to build some of the interface modules.

What You Will Learn
* Understand the concepts behind alarm systems and intrusion detection devices
* Connect sensors and devices to the on-board digital GPIO ports safely
* Monitor and control connected devices easily using Bash shell scripting
* Build an I/O port expander using the I2C bus and connect sensors and anti-tamper circuits
* Capture and store images using motion detectors and cameras
* Access and manage your system remotely from your mobile phone
* Receive intrusion alerts and images through your e-mail
* Build a sophisticated multi-zone alarm system

In Detail
The Raspberry Pi is a powerful low-cost credit-card-sized computer, which lends itself perfectly as the controller for a sophisticated home security system. Using the on-board interfaces available, the Raspberry Pi can be expanded to allow the connection of a virtually infinite number of security sensors and devices. The Raspberry Pi has the processing power and interfaces available to build a sophisticated home security system but at a fraction of the cost of commercially available systems.

Building a Home Security System with Raspberry Pi starts off by showing you the Raspberry Pi and how to set up the Linux-based operating system. It then guides you through connecting switch sensors and LEDs to the native GPIO connector safely, and how to access them using simple Bash scripts. As you dive further in, youâ€™ll learn how to build an input/output expansion board using the I2C interface and power supply, allowing the connection of the large number of sensors needed for a typical home security setup.

In the later chapters of the book, we'll look at more sophisticated topics such as adding cameras, remotely accessing the system using your mobile phone, receiving intrusion alerts and images by e-mail, and more.

By the end of the book, you will be well-versed with the use of Raspberry Pi to power a home-based security system that sends message alerts whenever it is triggered and will be able to build a truly sophisticated and modular home security system. You will also gain a good understanding of Raspberry Pi's ecosystem and be able to write the functions required for a security system.

To do DSP effects on a computer, you need to keep sub 25 msec latency. Hard to do, especially with USB audio interfaces and even harder with the Pi.

You could consider an ADC over SPI, but these are not available off-the-shelf. You'd need to build it, or buy one of the ADC boards available for the Pi.

As for your problem in the classroom, start with getting a good cardiod lavalier mic. Attach it near enough to your voice to pick up a decent input signal.

Then start by experimenting with a phase inverted mixer.

As for the sound of fans, it can't be filtered. Not in the analog, nor in the digital domain. It's too close to white noise and as such, too unpredictable to generate a noise killer anti-sound. Just filtering off higher frequencies (> 5kHz) will be about all you can do.

Engine sounds can be fairly predictable, but wind noise from the plane will blur your signal. I've never tried it, but it might just work.

Try looking for open source DAW plugins (VST format, usually) and see if you can use some of the code. Using an existing VST means you can experiment with the various DSP functions on your computer in software such as Audacity. Much easier to test the effect before you start implementing it on the Pi.

And to improve volume levels, you need to compress. Which is also available as a VST plugin. Also a lot easier than noise cancellation..."," Mon Oct 07, 2013 12:54 pm",711,"Wed Dec 05, 2012 4:48 pm","Active noise (acoustic) cancellation"

I solved this by using the coordinates of the detected motion box and a bash script to verify that the motion area is really moving (which is not the case for just changing light conditions).
Here is the approach, maybe it helps you for other projects:

a) Make the following changes to the /etc/motion/motion.conf (beside your other adaptions to camera modes, etc):

locate_motion_mode on
locate_motion_style box

picture_filename %v-%Y%m%d%H%M%S-%K-%L # this saves the x,y coordinates %K and %L to the pic filename

b) Write the following bash script in your /home/pi/ directory which is triggered by motion on event start:

#!/bin/sh
cd /home/pi/pictures
# Pause--------------

# Select last saved picture pic1, will be used to send via email-----------

Long story short, I am just getting into bee keeping, and want to make a hive moniter so I can keep an eye on my girls on days when I cant get to the hive (for example, bad weather meaning its a bad idea to open the hive)...

so my plan is to have a pi zero (when they start manufacturing and selling them again soon ), with 3 temp and humidity sensors placed through my hive (one in the brood box, and one in each of my 2 suppers)

however I also want to build in a pi based apidictor For anyone who doesnt want to read all that page, basically, its a tool to listen to bee's.

anyway, I digress. I'm wondering how easy it would be to include a microphone, isolate this band, and post it to a website hosted on the pi? maybe even with an image of the wave form pattern (am i making any sense?)

Penagwin,

First, make sure you are plugging your Arduino into a powered usb hub. The Arduino will draw too much power to power it right from the Pi.

When you run the IDE, you will look in the Tools menu and choose which board you are using. Then you will choose which port it is plugged into, ei. mine is:

Arduino Duemilanove w/ ATmega328 on /dev/ttyUSB0.

Everything else is the same as using it with Windows or Mac.

The average criminal is getting more sophisticated. Even reed sensors are easily fooled with a strong magnet. Recessed reed sensors are much better because it becomes harder to circumvent. Window vibration is another bit of protection. PIR sensors are great but can get false alarms if pets are in the house.

A lot of security companies are going down the external video route - they monitor premises and trigger a call centre on movement when armed - operators can then shout at intruders and call police. This is supposed to be 99% effective and stops them from even getting a foot inside.

I'm paranoid about power being cut or wireless jammed. I'm working on a solution whereby nodes ping each other via wifi - if a ping is lost, the alarm is triggered in case there is wifi jamming - these nodes are basically a RPi in each room where window/doors are hardwired back to an RPi - this then polls back to the server RPi which does the coordination.

I used a lipo rider pro board from seeedstudio as a poor mans UPS in case the power is cut.

It also uses a gsm modem to send text/phone alerts in case the the broadband connection is down/cut. - there is a wonderful GSMmodem project in python to do this

There is also turning on/off of devices via Bye Bye Standby/Home Easy/Klik an Klaut - rcswitch library performs this functionality. I'm thinking of changing this for Zwave or Insteon due to them being older devices and less secure/reliable.

I had hoped to use the new camera module for the RPi but unfortunately there is an IR filter so no nightvision Instead I'm planning on hooking up a webcam and using the ""motion"" library which looks extremely promising.

Hi there. I couldn't find any documentation, but what I did (before finding the issue I described below) is to trace/sniff/capture Bluetooth communication from the vendor's app. Was initially thinking of an adapter (Bluefruit LE Sniffer?) but I then worked with an old rooted Nexus 7 tablet and the Developer option to enable ""Bluetooth HCI snoop"" (copied the log file off using a File Manager app not adb). Easy & free! Just remember to write down when you pressed what button, so you can correlate the Bluetooth data to your actions.

This is my first project, and I am looking for some guidance on how to make it happen! Here is the jist. The base will be a rasberry pi with 3 DS18B20 temp sensors, 1 DHT22 temp/humidity sensor, and a 4 channel sainsmart relay. I also want the capability to have remote nodes that consist of the above sensors / relays, operated by an ESP8266 board with an MCP23S08 to expand I/O capability. The basic jist of this will be to have the base as well as remote devices reporting sensor data at pretty frequent intervels (1-5 minutes) and somehow have it automatically turn off devices based on sensor data such as if it is too cold, turn on this device. There will also be a remote cloud based master link that will offer additional features such as long-term sensor storage (over 1 year, most likely running MYSQL as the local rasberry pi base will only store 7 days worth of sensor data to keep it lean in an MYSQL db) as well as a website that can easily be accessed from anywhere and can control the base. This is primarily needed due to this base needing to be able to control the devices if the internet is down.

My main concern right now is how will all this data flow, first to the base from any remote sensors / base unit sensors and then into the cloud. I currently have scripts that run to retrieve the sensor data and import it into the base's MYSQL database. After reading some about dreamfactory API's and such, I am now questioning my approach and think there may be a better more reliable way of doing this. My original plan for automating the devices was scripts running every 5 minutes that determined if the temp was too low, turn on this device, etc. and it all needs to be configurable from a website.

I have been experimenting with the Raspberry Pi (model B), Adafruit PCA9685 16 Channel Servo Driver and InvenSense MPU6050 gyro and accelerometer for a fair while. I put together an app (AllMyServos), written in Python, to help me work with them. I created a repo for it on GitHub and I did intend to add it on the Pi Store but that seems to be defunct.

I built a 16 DOF (degrees of freedom) humanoid biped based on the SainSmart 17 DOF biped but the app is designed to handle any servo configuration (although I haven't been able to test multiple Adafruit servo drivers yet). The 17th degree of freedom is the head (which is currently not connected).

The configuration is done through a Graphical User Interface (provided by TkInter) but there is also a command line script which can be run over SSH to start the motion scheduler, RPC (remote procedure call) server and keyboard services.

The party piece is the Blender integration. Blender is an open source 3D modelling and animation program. AllMyServos includes a Blender addon which allows live commands to be sent from a Blender armature (in pose mode) to the servos. Keyframed animations can also be exported to AllMyServos for later use. The app also includes the specification for my robot (Vanguard) and the blend file so you can reproduce it quickly without doing all of the setup. Any specifications you create in the app can be packaged and shared.

I would appreciate any feedback from the community on the project so far.

Thanks for the excellent post!

I love the idea of having a raspberry Pi working as Time Machine.

I'm sorry if what I am going to ask looks dumbâ€¦ I am not really that computer-savy, even though with some effort, I end up managing to do what I want.

1st: Is it required that the Raspberry Pi Time Capsule is in the same local network (LAN or Wireless) as the laptop you want to backup from?
I'm asking because I travel quite a lot, and for me the best would be to have the Raspberry Pi at my parents place, where it is safe, and have my laptop (slowly) backup to there whenever I'm online. Time is not really an issue, I would say, because the process could be going for several days. This would be just a safety measure, in case something bad happens to the laptop, where I have most of my work.

2nd: If not possible using Time Machine, would it work as a NAS server?

I aim to build a general purpose portable computer with this and a LVDS 16"" panel, which also has GPIO. I have a couple of questions:
The vendor on eBay states that a ""12V, 4A"" adapter is essential, does this mean that I would need a power supply that exceeds 4A (~5A) in order to take to rPi under load? How much current did the LCD you had need to draw?
Will the board create 5VDC in the supply first then the rest goes to power the LCD? Furthermore, in layman's terms, how did you wire the voltage regulator up to the board and the power source to the rPi?

Apologies if I am bombarding you with questions, and I am sure I could figure it out by trial and error, but I fear that I may fry my pi or my LCD board, and my time frame is quite strict (I need this by June 5). I will be buying the components off of eBay soon.

I just have a quick question to see if something exists or not??

Basically I'm after a relay board that houses some (at least 1 maybe more) DPDT relays that can take UK mains voltage and up to 7A. In line with this I'm also wondering if they can be run through a hall sensor?

Effectively, I'm designing a system to automate my house lighting, but as I'll be using normal wall switches (i deliberately want to keep the mains lighting system and have this as a 'bolt on') I need a hall sensor to detect if the light it's actually on. As just measuring a energised/de-energised relay won't tell the system if the light is actually on or off.

I've found a SPDT board with 4 relays on which I could use, but as it's missing the current sensor element, I didn't know if it's worth building the ideal board outright.

I2C and SPI are on different pins and yes you can use both at the same time. I have done it myself.

I'm trying to do the same thing on my pi, but I'm having issues with the I2C running correctly while running the SPI as well. What clock rates are you running the SPI and I2C interfaces at? Is each interface running in a separate thread or executable? I have to run the SPI interface at 8Mhz for one device, but I leave the I2C device clocked at the default 100kHz.

The SPI and I2C clock rates are independent and the actual transfers are handled by dedicated hardware. It makes no difference if you run separate threads or not.


That's what I had figured, but I wasn't sure because if I run both of my executables at the same time my I2C readings goes to hell. If I don't run my SPI and I2C executables simultaneously, but run them independently, then they run perfectly (reading data at the rates they are configured without data corruption). But, if I start my I2C executable first and then start my SPI executable, the I2C readings come through corrupted or don't come through at all. Although, the SPI readings come through fine. So I was trying to see if anyone has experienced this as well."," Mon Feb 22, 2016 8:23 am",2,"Fri Feb 19, 2016 2:53 pm","I2C and SPI at same time?"

I also worked on this problem (how to connect 5 AM2320 digital temp/humidity sensors (variant of AM2302)) to the Raspberry Pi. I decided to connect the sensors to a custom programmed Atmel AVR micro (ATTiny261) and use the proprietary one wire interface that the manufacturer Aosong supports. The AVR implements the I2C slave device (SMBus protocol commands) and the RPi just uses the I2C bus and SMBus commands to get the sensor readings. I went with the I2C slave approach because of the high speed timing requirements of the one wire interface (I don't have to worry about RPi interrupts).

Not sure what the best approach is for the relays. I would consider one of the multichannel solid state relay boards you can get on eBay that might be able to be driven directly from GPIOs.

I'm interested in doing some imaging of a nearby lake bottom that may have some native american structures in it (which is interesting because it is not man-made, some believe a flood may have rerouted a river into a small village or temple). The lake is about 60 feet deep at most with most of the interesting features around 30-45 I think. I have family near the lake who rent a boat occasionally that I could hitch a ride on. I currently have a B+, a zero, and an Arduino Uno. I also have laptops and some linux experience if needed.

I've seen roughly three ways to accomplish this:
1) Spend $500 on a GPS-enabled sonar system from Garmin or a competitor that does everything for you
2) Spend $40 + $40 on a used fish-finder and a used GPS unit from eBay and use software like Dr. Depth on a laptop
3) Spend $50 to $150 and use incredible electrical and code skills (that I don't have) to develop a complex custom solution.

Dr Depth looked great (Google image search shows very cool results) but it was sold off and is no longer available.

Has anyone worked in these areas, specifically with underwater sonar? Are there any known software packages for a Pi to log GPS with sonar depth to develop bathymetric maps? As far as skill, I can follow schematics/directions and come up with basic circuits, but my coding is limited and poor. Obviously the cost of option 2 is attractive as this is just a side project...I'm not a fisherman or much of a water person...I just love history and gadgets. The most recent survey of the lake was 1955 and can be found here: http://dnr.wi.gov/lakes/maps/DNR/0830700a.pdf

Any suggestions are welcome, thank you and good luck with what you all are working on!

I don't think it is possible (Single wifi work as both AP and client). Not because of the Pi3 but the way wireless interfaces work. The protocols and features running on the wireless AP are different from a regular wifi client.

In order to have a Pi3 device connected as AP and Client you need two Wifi cards. (I actually have a similar setup).

If you want an WIFI extender, it is possible to do it. but the Pi won't have access to the network. meaning that the Pi won't have an IP associated to it but will be responsible for creating and relaying access to other stations thru its wifi interface. this is an old feature called ESS. The SSID (network name) will be the same of the network the pi is connected to. Like a repeater

The closest you could get with one wifi card from the design you're proposing is an Ad Hoc network. Other clients can connect to the station and the station can relay traffic to another station until it reaches one with connectivity to the internet. Windows laptops and o that with a wizard for instance. However you have to configure that manually in Pi and the remote AP must support this mode. Finally, the performance will be far from what you would expect... don't even think about watching videos over it.

But you can try and see if it fits.

@Drew: Do you have any tips on which type / brand of wifi dongle I should go for? I admittedly know too little about wireless network technology (I'm a software guy). If you have any references to an article / post that outlines how to use kismet for this purpose, that'd be great as well.


For Kismet I think wifi cards that support monitor mode is suffice. I think it helps to have an antenna socket so you can use directional or more powerful antenna at a later date, but the power usage will mean the Pi needs a USB hub with it's own power supply.
I have an Alfa AWUS036NHA (uses ath9k_htc driver). It works OK with the Pi but sometimes the driver doesn't get loaded at boot, replugging usually fixes it. I think it could be down to my USB hub, it's usually fine if I don't have the ethernet connected. You can certainly find other cards that use a bit less power & still support monitor mode.

I use the aircrack.org compatibility page as a starting point, I suspect some of it may be out of date, it is focused on the aircrack suite which does injection & cracking, so you can ignore those features if you only want monitor mode.
http://aircrack-ng.org/doku.php?id=comp ... ty_drivers

I've seen kismet guides for Arch linux http://cyantific.de/tutorials/archlinux ... -tutorial/ <-- he made a nice case too.
Heres an example using kismet on older 'pwnpi' OSâ€¦

I tried Kismet in Rasbian, Arch and Kali linux. Kali is probably easiest because it has all the correct software, drivers and tools you will ever need. You can also run the desktop version in a VM/ live boot incase you want to try something out on a quicker machine or test something to breaking point.

You could probably follow any 'raspberry pi wardriving' guide, just leave out the bits that mention gpsd unless you want to have GPS logging too. If kismet_server is too RAM heavy you can still monitor & parse out the various mac addresses & probe responses via tcpdump or tshark, but kismet is ideal. The manual has a bit of info on low RAM systems.

drushtx,https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=14783,"I run a small AV rental company in Houston, TX. We rent PA systems, up lights, dance lights, projection gear etc. This past week, we produced a couple of shows for a stage magician. Among his requirements were to have two projectors in the front corners of the venue displaying the promo image for his act. Our usual approach to two identical projections is to feed an image/show from a laptop into one projector and then daisy-chain to the second projector or, if the distance is too great, to feed a splitter box and run two outputs from the spitter to the projectors. Because of the width of the hall, both solutions were impractical and it's a pricey proposition to to pick up an HDMI to CAT5 conversion system.

In comes the Pi. Since it is a static image, I figured that I could just use some image viewing software, point to the image file and run a separate pi at each projector station. On the surface, a pretty easy looking project.

Project goals:
The act is generally a one-man show. The talent is not computer savvy so it had to be totally automated - plug it in and let it go.
The system must operate completely standalone. boot up, autolog in, launch the viewer, display the image and not dim out in a power saving mode. No network is needed so the only connections would be power and video.

I did a bit of Googling and found a picture frame project by Gus at http://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-photo-frame/ that uses feh as the image engine.

My first real complexity was that I decided to translate his project into use not on a Raspberry Pi but on an Orange Pi One and instead of running an ""orange version of Raspian,"" it runs Ubuntu Mate. It took about 8 hours of on and off effort/trial and error. There was also a bit of a of challenge getting the thing to autolaunch.(rc.local turned out to be futile, as did crontab) but I finally got it going on Monday - five days before the show.

The next day, I pulled out an original Raspberry Pi model A. It never had acceptable XBMC/KODI performance and wound up sitting on a game room table for a few years. For this simple project, it seemed to be up to the task as far as specs go. It was running Raspian from 2013 so I started down the long road of update/upgrade. Of course, this would be a much quicker task since the project from Gus would match the Raspian settup, right? For want of a nail, the kingdom was lost. We'll get back to that.

So I ran through the project steps, added the autologin from raspi-config and gave it a test run. Unlike on the Orange Pi, I could not get a successful test from the command line - not direct entry to the terminal, not calling it from a bash script and certainly not executing it with a bash call from rc.local. Kept getting the same problem - unable to open X display. I'll look at it with fresh eyes in the morning.

Next day, I spent a bunch of time researching the error message but didn't find anything that was germane to my situation. I made so many changes that I figured I should cut my losses, blast the whole thing away and start up a fresh image. So, newest Raspian installed (post 3/18), I fired up Gus' steps again. And got the same result.

Troubleshooting:
Can't be the image engine or the project process - I have personally made it work.
Not likely to be the OS - tried two different version of Raspian.
Could be the board? I have tons of Pis around to and can try another board but that didn't seem likely.
Could be the user? Almost surely. When I encounter a computer problem , it's usually mechanical (there's a nut loose behind the keyboard).
So, I started the project clean and did nothing from memory. When I got down to setting the display variable, there it was. I had been operating that line zillions of times with a faulty memory of what it was supposed to be. The lined begins:

""DISPLAY=:0,0...""

Somewhere along the way, I had dropped the "":"" by entering ""DISPLAY=0.0...""

So, for want of a "":"" the project was lost.

Popped the colon back into place and abracadabra, alacazam, voila! She is finished.

Last problem was getting it to run per Gus' instructions about launching it from rc.local.

His code of ""bash /home/start-picture-frame.sh &"" didn't have enough oomph behind it so a slight modification to:

su â€“ pi -c â€˜/bin/bash /home/pi/start-picture-frame.sh &â€™ and all the goals were met. Total time and effort (on and off between ""real"" projects at work was another 8 hours!

When I set up the system, my talented magician friend did not have a clear picture of my description of the Pi and how I would use it. He was kind of forced to accept my ""trust me."" And to be honest, I had a case of nerves and brought along a laptop to the gig in case I had to shell into a Pi for a fix or to use it a replacement for a failed solution. Fortunately, both Pis worked flawlessly. Whew! He was completely knocked out - much as his audience at the show finale were when he opened a locked box from the beginning of the act with a large poster in it that had answers given by audience members throughout the show. I have a feeling that we're going to find a way to get an RPi onto the magic stage before the year is out.

Now that it's a proven quantity, I will offer this as a service to my customers as the computer of choice for those events that have slide shows (brides and grooms love to have a display up of the couples pictures from childhood through the wedding day), videos and wherever else I can use it to source the projectors. Saves room and hassle of dealing with laptops, various video connectors and they're wonderfully compact and convenient.

If the negative is connected to ground how do I use power from a 6 v battery pack


At the very beginning of Joan's video, you'll see an alligator clip attached to the battery pack's negative connector. This negative line passes through the BEC (battery elimination circuit (converting the battery voltage to a save 5V level but the ground line likely just passes through)). After passing through the BEC, it's connected to the blue bus on the breadboard. The black wire on the left connects the ground from the battery pack to the R Pi. You can see the many servos also have their ground connections made to this same blue bus on the breadboard.

The servos are powered by the red bus on the breadboard which has 5V from the BEC. You don't want to power servos from the Pi's 5V line (you might get away with a single small servo but I don't think that's a good idea either).

It looks like the Raspberry Pi is being powered by the USB connector.

Coincidental with this post, we've been working with ownCloud on an appliance solution for them and the Pisces cover was created at their request. You can see discussion of our collaboration in blogs by Jos Poortvliet, ownCloud's community manager. Now we're targeting a different enclosure platform with them that we'll start piloting in a few weeks.

Sounds like you only have access from within your local network and that your router is not properly forwarding the port OR your work is blocking the use of port 2223 which is a possibility depending on how your work controls network access."," Wed Dec 05, 2012 5:53 pm",606,"Thu Aug 16, 2012 8:35 pm","Accessing SSH outside local network"

ed_rockstarguy,https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=174349,"Today I am going to share a quick and simple project I worked on that you can try with your very own raspberry pi 3.

What was the goal?
My goal was to have a desktop environment with me at all times that I could use. I discovered other solutions to this problem but they all required uninterrupted internet connections.

What you will require
- PI3
- Battery pack(Optional)
- Mobile Phone or tablet


What we will be doing to achieve the goal?
We will be turning the raspberry pi into a wirless hotspot (Just like a home router) for your phone/tablet to connect to, then we will be installing a VNC package to the pi that will allow us to access the desktop environment.

Setting up the wireless hotspot
Before we start please make sure you have ran the following commands to make sure your pi is up to date
CODE: SELECT ALL
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade


Next we Install the required packages
CODE: SELECT ALL
sudo apt-get install dnsmasq hostapd


Now that everything is downloaded we need to configure the dhcpcd.conf

CODE: SELECT ALL
sudo nano /etc/dhcpcd.conf


Now at the bottom of the file type this and save with CTRL+X

CODE: SELECT ALL
interface wlan0 
    static ip_address=172.24.1.1/24


We also need to make sure wpa_supplicant does not interfere with the wifi by editing

CODE: SELECT ALL
sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces


And modifiing the line 'wpa-conf /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf' to be commented out like so

CODE: SELECT ALL
allow-hotplug wlan0 
iface wlan0 inet manual 
#    wpa-conf /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf


Now we need to add a configuration file to hostapd

CODE: SELECT ALL
nano /etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf


and paste the following code into the nano editor

CODE: SELECT ALL
# This is the name of the WiFi interface we configured above
interface=wlan0

# Use the nl80211 driver with the brcmfmac driver
driver=nl80211

# This is the name of the network
ssid=Pi3-AP

# Use the 2.4GHz band
hw_mode=g

# Use channel 6
channel=6

# Enable 802.11n
ieee80211n=1

# Enable WMM
wmm_enabled=1

# Enable 40MHz channels with 20ns guard interval
ht_capab=[HT40][SHORT-GI-20][DSSS_CCK-40]

# Accept all MAC addresses
macaddr_acl=0

# Use WPA authentication
auth_algs=1

# Require clients to know the network name
ignore_broadcast_ssid=0

# Use WPA2
wpa=2

# Use a pre-shared key
wpa_key_mgmt=WPA-PSK

# The network passphrase
wpa_passphrase=raspberry

# Use AES, instead of TKIP
rsn_pairwise=CCMP


Next we edit hostapd file and change the '#DAEMON_CONF=""""'
to this 'DAEMON_CONF=""/etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf""' by running this command and inputing the text

CODE: SELECT ALL
sudo nano /etc/default/hostapd



We are almost done configuring the wifi and we just need to modify the dnsmasq config and run a few more commands.

Next we need to run

CODE: SELECT ALL
sudo mv /etc/dnsmasq.conf /etc/dnsmasq.conf.orig 
sudo nano /etc/dnsmasq.conf


and add the following code to the file

CODE: SELECT ALL
interface=wlan0      # Use interface wlan0 
bind-interfaces      # Bind to the interface to make sure we aren't sending things elsewhere 
server=8.8.8.8       # Forward DNS requests to Google DNS 
domain-needed        # Don't forward short names 
bogus-priv           # Never forward addresses in the non-routed address spaces. 
dhcp-range=172.24.1.50,172.24.1.150,12h # Assign IP addresses between 172.24.1.50 and 172.24.1.150 with a 12 hour lease time 


Now, if we have the raspberry pi plugged into the lan when at home we want to be able to forward the internet through the wifi, we achieve this with.
[code]sudo nano /etc/sysctl.conf[/code]
and removing the # from the line 'net.ipv4.ip_forward=1'

Lastly for this part we run

CODE: SELECT ALL
sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE 
sudo iptables -A FORWARD -i eth0 -o wlan0 -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT 
sudo iptables -A FORWARD -i wlan0 -o eth0 -j ACCEPT 
sudo reboot


Once the pi has rebooted, hop onto your phone and you should see a wifi network called 'Pi3-AP' and when you connect the password is 'raspberry'


Setting up VNC (Much Quicker)

Start off by installing x11vnc with

CODE: SELECT ALL
sudo apt-get install x11vnc


Once installed type

CODE: SELECT ALL
x11vnc


and fill in the password and save it with a [y]

Next we will run the VNCserver with

CODE: SELECT ALL
x11vnc -display :0 -usepw


Lastly install on your phone connect to the wifi and download a VNC client of your choice, then connect to it with 172.24.1.1 and port 6900 and its done!


You can also attach a battery pack and take your PI on the road with you and as long as your connected to its wifi your set!

You could make your seismometer... just for fun: I know in your area there are strong hearthquakes, but you can only detect hearthquakes through ""broad-band"" seismometers (really hard to build), we use ADC starting from 20 bits ap to 24 bits.

So, the only one thing you can do (I still talk as ""professional"" point of view) is to use accelerometers. I've seen on the web a lot of projects of low-cost accelerometers for seimic use, made through MEMS accelerometers (like LIS3LV02DQ from ST). If you prefear there are also the analog-output version you can read with ADC.

Then, you also need a software to ""detect"" seismic wave from ""others"" waves.

Keep in mind, if you'll build a ""serious"" seismometer, it will be very sensible to external ""noises"", like steps, cars, and so on.

My first advice would be to use regular gearmotors - just because it's simpler. The sun moves slowly enough that with the right gearing you can ""bump"" the array and it won't over travel. I might try a cordless screwdriver for a motor with some additional gearing for a cheap motor.

Even before you get that far - install the wiring pi library and read up on that on the wiringpi website - master reading inputs and using that data to manipulate outputs to LEDS. Once that is done it's an easy matter to swap LEDs for relays.

Tony is correct about the tables and timing, and that would require either a stepper or some kind of feedback for positioning. I guess it also depends on how precise you want to go - Keep in mind I just wanted to focus the sunlight from several 1mx2m mirrors onto a single .25mx.25 target to heat a tank of water across the yard - I tried a few ways (trying to find the most economical/fastest way to build dozens of these things) and what ended up being the cheapest/fastest to produce was actually to not even use a microcontroller but rather to make the circuit relatively ""dumb."" I had photo transistors feeding at the array and around the target and using windshield wiper motors, I let one axis go back and forth (when sensor said there was enough light to bother) until it lined up, the other axis was enable to do the same. The phototransistors at the array fed relays which took signal the 12 meters or so back to the array where the controller was. I wish I had photos or a schematic or something...been a long time

Of course this was before I had a pi and was using basic stamps and picax micros. I might use the pi now...I'll ponder this a little on my drive and chime back in later."," Sat Dec 26, 2015 7:34 am",99,"Tue Dec 15, 2015 9:55 am","2 axis Heliostat / Sunfollower"

I've recently moved out of house (1st of this month, to be precise), and I'm working on automating pretty much everything in my apartment.
I've put in an order for several of these for my lights.

Now I want to remote control and be able to program my thermostat. Unfortunately, I do not have a lot of experience when it comes to wiring and circuitry. I am purely a programmer.

I've gathered as much information about my current, relatively new (~2000's) thermostat, which actually looks older than it is. Here's a picture:


From what I've gathered, it has pretty much no control over the actual heating system. It seems to be an on/off switch. It does not care if it's set to 30 degrees, and it's -20 inside. I believe it simply tells the central heater to turn on/off.
Here's a picture of the insides, with the front removed:


The red sticker you see underneath the cable is partially in Dutch. I've re-drawn it for more clarity here:


I've gone ahead and measured the voltages on the different wires in the on/off state, and noted them here. I'm not entirely sure what the blue and brown cables are, so I've written them as ""blue"" and ""brown"". Please excuse me. Though I do know yellow/green is ground. But they may of course have just hooked up randomly colored wires. The apartment I live in has to be over 100 years old or so, and you can clearly see that this thermostat, and possibly even the heating was added AFTER the building was built.
It actually looks like holes were drilled to put the heating through. Anyhow, the currents, I'm not sure which to put the + and - meters on, so here are the upper and lower results that I got when switching them around.

OFF
Ground + Blue = 25.4V - 26.5V
Ground + Brown = 25.3V - 26.5V
Blue + Brown = 00.0V

ON
Ground + Blue = 23.1V - 24.2V
Ground + Brown = 00.4V - 00.5V
Blue + Brown = 23.4V - 22.2V

Now, please tell me if I did something wrong, because the 23.3V and 26.5V seem off. Maybe that's normal, but I don't know. I had my multi meter set to 200V AC.

So, I may be entirely wrong, but would it be possible to simply connect 2 wires together, and have it switch on/off?
Will this sort of remote switch be sufficient? I'm afraid it only accepts 12V AC, but as you've probably noticed by now, not an expert at this

I've also checked the installation manual for my central heating system (Vaillant 255/3), but it does not specify anything about the actual thermostat. Only how to connect it, and to then further reference the manual of the thermostat.


Any help would be greatly appreciated. If you need more information, please tell me, I'll be as fast as possible to reply"," Thu Oct 23, 2014 1:27 pm",1,"Thu Oct 23, 2014 12:18 pm","Remote-controlling thermostat"

I am using a Raspberry Pi B+ as some sources say that the Neopixels won't work on the Rapsberry 2 yet, although I do have a 2 if anyone suggests trying it on there !!! I initially had the ground for the Neopixels and the GPIO audio trigger buttons are all connected up together which I thought could be causing the problem, but I still get the same results when I use separate ground pins.


Hi James75!

I am so happy to answer your question, though please take my answer with a grain of salt as I am a RPi/Python newbie.

Basically, the NeoPixels work off of PWM. And so does the analog audio jack, for the sound. I found this out when I ran into the same issue on my own sound and light project on my Pi B...whenever I played a sound my NeoPixels were ""sparkling"" in time to the sound, and whenever I did NeoPixel stuff interference came through the speakers.

To get around this, basically you have to run the sound through HDMI instead of through the analog audio jack on the Pi. HDMI sound output on the Pi does not use PWM.

This is what I did:

1.) Buy an HDMI in to VGA out converter *with separate sound output jack* and connected it to the HDMI port of the Pi. I found mine at Best Buy in the computer section for $39 though I am sure you can get them cheaper online. I do not recommend this cheap $7 style adapter as on mine, the audio jack input soldering broke inside the adapter, which is why I had to run to Best Buy and get a beefier one.
2.) Plug speaker input into audio output jack on HDMI to VGA converter. Do this with speakers volume turned off so you do not blow out speakers/damage your ears with feedback.
3.) Now I set up the Pi to force the audio out through the HDMI. Go into a Terminal window and at the prompt type:
CODE: SELECT ALL
amixer cset numid=3 2
(2 stands for HDMI, 1 for analog output jack and 0 for automatic detection).
4.) Set the output volume of the Pi. For some reason it is not set very high by default. Again, in Terminal, type:
CODE: SELECT ALL
alsamixer
and you will get a graphical interface. Press F3 to navigate to your playback device and press the up arrow key until you get the volume up pretty high. I like it about 90% high or more. With alsamixer you can also make sure that your audio channels are all unmuted. Escape exits and saves your config.
5.) Test sound by going to terminal and typing:
CODE: SELECT ALL
speaker-test -c2 -t wav
- remember to turn up any seperate power/volume on your speakers as well!
6.) If this sound test does not work you may need to edit your config file. (I had to do this.)
At Terminal prompt, type:
CODE: SELECT ALL
sudo nano /boot/config.txt

Uncomment the line
CODE: SELECT ALL
#hdmi_drive=2
(ie, take away the #)
Save the file (ctrl+O)
Exit the nano text editor (ctrl+X)
Restart the Pi to apply the changes you made to the config file. At Terminal prompt type:
CODE: SELECT ALL
sudo shutdown -r 0

7.) Then try the test sound at step 5 again once the Pi has restarted.

This worked for me. Good luck!!

The goal of a project is to build a system that can be compared to a simplified Roland SPD-SX sampling pad, although at this point in time Iâ€™m not looking for sampling capabilities, Iâ€™m just interested in playback.

Basically, the system comprises a number of drum pads and/or pedal controls. I have a few spare Roland pads (PD-8A â€“ single trigger) and a FD-8 hi-hat controller which Iâ€™d like to use. Those pads have Â¼â€ female jacks to which you can connect an unbalanced TRS cable. Iâ€™d add similar jacks to a Raspberry, connecting them to the GPIO so that I can trigger events by hitting the pads. The pads have a piezo element under a rubber coating, I guess thereâ€™s nothing special here. I still need to find out how the hi-hat controller works.

drum sample triggers.jpg (12.98 KiB) Viewed 49 times


At this point in time, I think Iâ€™ll design the system for four triggers.

Software running in the Raspberry Pi should then intercept the trigger signals and play an audio file depending on which pad has been hit. Audio out should go to the headphone jack.

The audio file should be played either a single time or it should loop until a next hit on the same pad stops the looping (this is basic programming, Iâ€™m ok with that). Audio files will be read from the SD card in the Raspberry.

Tricky things for which I need help:

1) in which environment should I write this kind program ? should it be done in C/C++ or will Python be ok ?
2) are there any libraries available that I can use, especially given the fact that I might need simultaneous playback of two or more audio files (because I might have a long-playing file on 1 pad, e.g. with a backing track, and I might want to hit one of the other pads with some percussive sound)
3) how about latency ? It is quite obvious that any triggered sound should play â€œimmediatelyâ€. Practically speaking, I think a delay between hitting a pad and hearing a sound not exceeding 10 to 12 milliseconds is acceptable, but anything beyond that might become problematic. This is also the reason why I want to avoid using MIDI and triggering a VST on a laptop. I prefer the system to be standalone.
4) also related to the latency, what is the reading speed of a wav file from an SD card ? Does it make sense to read from the card ? or should I rather read the files into memory so that they are readily available
5) can I use the â€œstandardâ€ Raspbian operating system ? or should I rather explore real-time operating systems ?

This thread is already giving some interesting ideas, but it doesnâ€™t discuss latency issues: https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=38&t=133789

FatalXception,https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=160449,"My first Raspberry Pi project is born out of necessity, and I've never attempted anything quite like this before. I'm currently in the planning phase. The dash lights in my car have burned out, and my options are to either buy ~$30 (or more) worth of parts to fix it or install a cheap aftermarket solution --OR-- to build my own. I think using a Pi Zero for this project would cost about the same (and it's worth it if it's a little more anyway). Objective would be to power everything from the car battery. I would want it to wait 3 seconds after detecting current to the headlights before energizing the Pi. This is to protect it from turning on while the car is starting- so if there is a better way to do this, I'm open. I would need a strip of LED's that are kind of bright and variable color (The strip would uniform color but I could change it on the fly, probably with a switch or button, or programmatically- I'd prefer to be able to use a PBNO to trigger it to change). I'd also like to be able to vary the intensity, probably with another PBNO- I like the idea of digital controls. I'd like to use a photosensor (perhaps stuck to the back of the mirror) to automatically turn on the lights. Can anyone recommend what parts I need and where to get them? Here's what I am envisioning:
-Pi Zero
-Enclosure for the Pi
-GPIO header
-4GB Micro SD card
-Power supply for Pi
-Fuse for Pi power supply
-varying color and intensity LED strip- would also need a low-profile enclosure or something with a backing so the light is directed to my gauges and I'm not looking straight into a strip of LED's when I check my speed
-2 pushbuttons- will need suggestions for appearance and some kind of enclosure, perhaps each is two switches, so we can go back without having to cycle through from the beginning- still haven't decided yet.
-light sensor that can withstand a fair amount of heat- Being mounted to the back of the mirror and being constantly exposed to sunlight coming through the windshield seems like it would need to be a rugged component.

Also, I need to know what the best way would be to power the LED's- Should this come through the Pi, or should the Pi act as a gate to switch on the LED's and provide a control mechanism- Should it be a power supply or just a controller? I'm planning to wire directly to the battery for any power needs- no cig lighter plugs. I'm thinking the hardware will be the most difficult part of the project- The scripting should be pretty easy.

So in a nutshell, I'm looking to build a project, probably with a Pi Zero, that will automatically turn on dash lights and allow me to customize the appearance for brightness and color, using pushbuttons on the GPIO's to do this- I want to make sure I have failsafes, so if something does go wrong, I can kill the lights, but I can just put a killswitch in line with the Pi power to accomplish this. Knowing me, I'll probably add a button down the road to save settings to the Pi.

My plan is to start with getting the Pi physically and logically working- that means getting the GPIO header installed, booting to Raspbian, then powering it directly from the car, getting the lights to come on at all, and then moving on to get the light sensor to turn the lights on, then the intensity controls working, then the color controls. I plan on using button presses on the GPIO to trigger scripts on the Pi to run the various functions.

So, with all that, I'm open to suggestions- I live in Pennsylvania in the US, about an hour from MicroCenter (Only store currently selling PI Zero and accessories), and I shop online as well for components. I have kids who will be very interested in working on the project, so it will create an educational opportunity as well as we get each piece working.

I have to deal with the first question: how/when can I get a Pi Zero? Microcenter is sold out and they are not on Amazon, plus I've read that they are sold out of the MagPi 40.
So far, I have created some things with the RPi2B- A couple of HTPC's and a content filtering proxy server, but these are mostly software-focused. This project will be more of a hardware and interfacing project. If I can't get a Pi Zero right away, I figure I can always 'borrow' one of my 2B's, which use a 2.5A power supply (Pi Zero accessory kits generally come with a 2A supply) and then I can swap in a Zero when available.

Sorry for the long post- just trying to get started and cover as many details as possible.
Can anyone recommend resources, brands, or even specific parts?
I appreciate any advice.

Yes. The one-wire bus can work over much longer distances, even with random chunks of wire and hacked connectors. It's also extremely easy to test this with cat5e patch leads stuck together. In fact, RJ45 connectors make a good choice for one-wire networks, or RJ12 phone connectors.

FigNewton,https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=152378,"I have been fiddling around with my new Raspberry Pi 2 for a couple of weeks now and came across the PirateBox (http://piratebox.cc/start) and was intrigued. I think that it's an excellent idea to be able to carry around a little device that can be used to distribute information. I have also been a long time fan of Project Gutenberg (http://www.gutenberg.org). So I got to thinking that it would make sense to use the Raspberry Pi to help distribute these free books. I came up with the name GutenFree for this goofy little project.

Project supplies:
RaspberryPi
Wifi Dongle that will support AP mode
16gb micro/sd card
Battery power for remote use

Step 1
The first step in my project was to acquire the Gutenberg DVD. I went with the April 2010 Dual Layer DVD image which is 8gb in size. You can choose which image you want from here:

http://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Gutenberg ... VD_Project

Step 2
After you have the DVD, you need to set up your sd card with Raspbian. I am not going to go into the specifics of this as it is well documented elsewhere. Don't forget to change your password for the user 'pi'. Also, make sure you are up to date with you libraries (sudo apt-get update, sudo apt-get upgrade).

Step 3
I used a wired connection for the rest of this setup so that I could get my wireless configured as an Access Point and still have an internet connection. If this is not feasible for you, then you might want to perform the wireless changes last after you get Apache installed. For step 3, I moved the iso file over to my sd card. There are multiple ways you can perform this. I sftp'ed the file over from my laptop. You could also mount your sd card on another machine and copy directly. Whatever works for you. Make sure you note the location of the iso file as you will need to set this up as a mount point later on. I put my Gutenberg iso in the following location: /home/pi/ProjectGutenberg/pgdvd042010.iso . My plan is to mount the iso in the /media folder under another folder name Gutenberg. So you need to cd to /media and 'sudo mkdir Gutenberg'. This will get the mount point set up that you will use later in the process.

Step 4
You need to set up your wireless card as an access point. There are a number of different tutorials on this around the web, and I am sure I used a couple of them to figure this out. I will leave this to you to configure to your specific wifi dongle if this doesn't work on yours. If you have issues, then dongle compatibility is most likely the cause. For this project I decided to set the ip range to 192.168.33.x. Thirty three rhymes with free, so it made sense to me. I also do not set up any kind of encryption. This is an open wifi connection. In my /etc/network/interfaces I have this:
CODE: SELECT ALL
#auto wlan0
allow-hotplug wlan0
iface wlan0 inet static
address 192.168.33.1
netmask 255.255.255.0
#wpa-conf /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf

I have this in my /etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf file
CODE: SELECT ALL
interface=wlan0
driver=rtl871xdrv
ssid=GutenFree
hw_mode=g
channel=1
macaddr_acl=0
auth_algs=1
ignore_broadcast_ssid=0
ieee80211n=1
wmm_enabled=1


Step 5
Install Apache2. (sudo apt-get install apache2). Now you don't have to use Apache as there are a couple of other http servers out there. I am familiar with Apache so I decided it would be what I went with. You are free to experiment with this as you see fit.

Here is what I used for my /etc/apache2/sites-available/default file entry. I have change the DocumentRoot, put in a Directory entry for the Gutenberg iso, and also put in some basic Track/Trace remediation entries for security.

CODE: SELECT ALL
<VirtualHost *:80>
   ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost

   #DocumentRoot /var/www
   DocumentRoot /media/Gutenberg
   <Directory />
      Options FollowSymLinks
      AllowOverride None

   <Directory /media/Gutenberg/>
      Options -Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
      AllowOverride None
      Order allow,deny
      allow from all
   </Directory>

   ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ /usr/lib/cgi-bin/
   <Directory ""/usr/lib/cgi-bin"">
      AllowOverride None
      Options +ExecCGI -MultiViews +SymLinksIfOwnerMatch
      Order allow,deny
      Allow from all
   </Directory>

   ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log

   # Possible values include: debug, info, notice, warn, error, crit,
   # alert, emerg.
   LogLevel warn

   CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined

   #Note, these are industry standard track trace remediation entries. One set is recommended in each
   #virtual host entry and one set outside of the virtual hosts.
   RewriteEngine on
   RewriteCond %{REQUEST_METHOD} ^(TRACE|TRACK)
   RewriteRule .* - [F]
</VirtualHost>

#Note, these are industry standard track trace remediation entries. One set is recommended in each
#virtual host entry and one set outside of the virtual hosts.
RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_METHOD} ^(TRACE|TRACK)
RewriteRule .* - [F]


Step 6
Install dnsmasq. I used the instructions from this website to set up a captive portal.
http://sirlagz.net/2013/08/23/how-to-ca ... pberry-pi/

sudo apt-get install dnsmasq
sudo vi /etc/dnsmasq.conf

CODE: SELECT ALL
#Added by FigNewton 7/9/15
interface=wlan0 # To get dnsmasq to listen only on wlan0.
dhcp-range=192.168.33.5,192.168.33.225,255.255.255.0,12h # This sets the available range from 192.168.33.5 to 192.168.33.225
# It also sets the subnet mask to 255.255.255.0 and specifies a lease time of 12 hours.

#This will redirect all traffic to the local website.
address=/#/192.168.33.1


Step 7
You want the Gutenberg iso to mount at boot time. I mounted it to /media/Gutenberg so that it would match the document root that I set up in the apache config file.

sudo vi /etc/fstab

CODE: SELECT ALL
#Adding in the Gutenberg ISO
/home/pi/ProjectGutenberg/pgdvd042010.iso /media/Gutenberg auto loop 0 0


Once all of this is set up, you can reboot the RaspberryPi and unplug the ethernet cable. This should reboot as a standalone access point with the name 'GutenFree' that you can connect to without a passcode. From there open your browser and point to any website and you should be re-directed to the Gutenberg CD. You can then look up any of the titles on the dvd and download them to your device. It is a fun little project and I plan to fire this up and leave it running anytime I am in town, or nearby where people might see it.

For my battery power, I am using a 6000mah Pocket Juice Multicharger that I picked up at WalMart. So far I am able to get 6-8 hours of runtime while still having a single bar (out of four) of power left in the device. I don't want to run down completely as I would rather power down the RaspberryPi on my own. For that, I connect to the GutenFree wifi network, and then telnet into 192.168.33.1 and login as 'pi' and my password. I have a terminal program on my phone that will ssh and allow me to issue the shutdown command.

I am open to any suggestions, ideas or contributions to this thread. If you decide to make one, post here and let us know.

This is the website you will see in your browser once connected.

Apologies that this has probably been asked time and time again but with so many options out there I'm finding it hard to find the best solution for my needs and I was hoping for some user input.

I am looking to do some basic home automation, my needs are:
Control 433mhz switches using the cheap 433 transmitter boards (ideally not a commercial 'gateway' product)
Monitor energy consumption of circuits (using CT sensors on individual circuits in the fuse board)
Monitor temperatures of rooms (either using some form of wireless sensors or Pi Zero's when they are available)
Configure actions based on rules (e.g. if temperature below 10 degrees, turn on heater in that room via 433mhz switch)
Possibly display/record video feeds or trigger actions from IP cameras (ONVIF or MJPEG streams)

Those are the basic functions I would like to achieve, I have got a load of 433mhz remote sockets already that I would like to use. I have already tried Domoticz but I found it difficult to integrate with the 433mhz without buying a gateway device, I was only able to control a single device from the 433mhz transmitter that I've got as it wasn't well-supported.

I'm not a programmer of any kind so building something myself wouldn't be a possibility but I could possibly do minor modifications to an existing software to make it suit my needs. I'm very much on a budget and I'm hoping a system like this will allow me to save money by keeping a better eye on consumption and energy costs, and turning off devices when not in use (e.g. when a webcam does not detect motion in a room, it will turn off the light for example) so I'm trying to keep my initial costs on hardware to a minimum as much as is possible. I'm very much hoping to use the Pi's functionality and GPIO with cheap component sensors as much as possible, I've got several Pi's so having one in each room with necessary sensors connected would easily be possible

What software would you suggest is a good starting point for such a system?"," Mon Mar 28, 2016 12:05 pm",17,"Mon Jul 15, 2013 3:27 am","Pre-built home automation OS suggestions"

Flausch,https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=147433,"I did some further joystick testing yesterday:

I unplugged my wireless keyboard-mouse combination and used a single wired keyboard. I also unplugged my xbox-gamepad and left only the two GPIO-Joysticks.

Because it is not possible to use these joysticks inside Retropie (not enough buttons), I quit to console and started UAE4ALL2 manually.

And guess what? I could start Great Courts II and play a two player game with both joysticks.

This was my expected behaviour after looking at the source code of the init function for joysticks:
CODE: SELECT ALL
if (nr_joysticks > 0)
    {
      uae4all_joy0 = SDL_JoystickOpen (0);
    }
    if (nr_joysticks > 1)
    {
      uae4all_joy1 = SDL_JoystickOpen (1);
    }

No matter what, port 0 is mapped hard to /dev/input/js0 and port 1 is mapped to /dev/input/js1.

In tests before, js0 was my xbox pad and there was some strange behaviour when a mouse was conntected, which got mapped to port 0 too somehow, but also blocked port 1. So my GPIO joysticks got ignored, because they were not the first two devices.

In yesterdays test one GPIO-Joystick was js0, the other was js1 and no other devices were conntected. Et voilÃ ... working!
But this is a terrible workaround.

The solution is to change the joystick init function and map it by the configuration gui. All that has to be done there, is to list every connected device (getting number of devices by SDL_NumJoysticks () and list names by SDL_JoystickName(joystick)). Then let the user choose which devices to use for each port.

My test was done using chips UAE4ALL2 version 5. I had some problems with UAE4ARM (no button click), which needs some further testing.
But the more I get into the source code, the more I get the impression this will not be too hard to fix. No magic needed..."," Wed May 20, 2015 12:09 am",12,"Wed May 13, 2015 2:15 am","Uae4arm: Amiga emulator with JIT and DispmanX"

flyswatter12,https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=178652,"Cool project. As others have mentioned, it could be a bit hazardous, but that's no reason not to try it. Just understand the risks first, ask for help if you need it, and be safe.

1) I would definitely keep the original touch pad and timing device from the microwave.
Why? The microwave was designed to be programmed using the touch pad, and all the necessary functionality is already in the controller board. The only alternative would be to really reverse engineer the microwave's internals and do a full-control type of system using the raspberry pi. This would be much more difficult, expensive, time consuming, and duplicate so much that can already be done by the microwave's computer, so there's no need to bother with it.

I'd tap into the original touch pad, and determine if it's a Serial or a cross-matrix touch pad. This will require some electronics test equipment, probably an oscilloscope and logic analyzer, so you can see what's going on when you press each of the buttons. From the photo it looks like it's probably a serial communicating touch pad. Great, either one is fine, just figure it out and understand exactly how it works, and how you can copy the commands it sends using the PI.

Next, make a map of what each button press does. Does it send a serial command? does it activate the microwave? Something else? Gotta understand it all and map it out before you can override it's functionality with your own.

Once it's all mapped out, figure out a way for the Pi to send the commands instead of the touch pad. It could be a simple piggy-back set of wires soldered onto the original communication lines, so it could inject commands into the microwave's control board. Probably is... but your group's EE should be able to help you figure it out if they even halfway showed up to class.

Then, bench test it and use the PI and see if you can use it to set a timer and start the microwave. Or even just input some numbers. Once you get that working, the rest should come along fairly easily. Make a format for the bar-code that you can decode in the Pi, and use that to set the timer and start the microwave. For example, if the barcode data is ""180HI"" that might mean that you microwave this item for 180 seconds on HI power level. Easy to decode. IF you'd rather use the original UPC barcode, then you need a lookup table for the Pi to see what the cooking directions are for whatever item you scan, and you'd have to manually load all the items you like to cook into the database.

As far as powering the Pi, just get a 120VAC to 5VDC wall wort, and power it from the AC power cord where it enters the microwave. Solder it on, keep it safe, and don't shock anybody.

As others have already mentioned, I wouldn't mess with the high power bits of the microwave, or try to operate it with the covers off. Microwave radiation is invisible and can really do some damage. Don't want to cook your eyeballs or anything. Also the flyback transformer usually has thousands of volts on it. So don't touch anything in there, and replace the covers before you try it out."," Tue Feb 23, 2016 4:36 pm",3,"Tue Feb 23, 2016 4:20 pm","Raspberry Pi Microwave + bar code Scanner"

I am building a device that allows objects to be recognized on a smart surface. We decided to stick with capacitive sensing.
See this for an example: https://www.tiggly.com/
The final design will be a modified version of the Magic Trackpad. https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Magic+T ... rdown/3395
It consists of a few blocks:
Sensor/Touch screen -> Controller -> Raspberrypi(outputs processed data - OBJ_ID at (X,Y) )+BT -> Tablet-> Application

I have a few questions:

-Is it realistic finish integrating the Controller and Digitizer into a working prototype in 1 month? I am a bachelor electronic engineering student
There is an option of buying a development kit with a screen or ready products but this is not really designing. Even with this option there is a lot of work to be done still, so i am worried about the timeline.
devkit: http://nl.farnell.com/microchip/dv10201 ... dp/2500452
example of controller: http://www.farnell.com/datasheets/1948343.pdf
example of Digitizer: http://www.ebay.de/itm/DIGITIZER-iPad-2 ... Swp5JWXK8R
-Do you know of Capacitive Touch controllers that are able to process Z-axis data/proximity as well, and output a diameter of the touch or distance from the surface? I need this in order to differentiate between merely taking your hand off the object, and taking the object off the surface.
- I am having difficulties in locating dev kits that are readily available or datasheets from these big manufacturers, why is that do you think? I tried farnell, mouser.

Also are any of you aware of any alternatives to the 16 channel servo driver? Maybe something written in C from the start..

It's only a few lines of code. I'm surprised you can't find a working port.

The Pi will provide the pulses if that's all you need, e.g. http://abyz.co.uk/rpi/pigpio/index.html


There's a very good reason to never use the pi for pwm motor control - and that is stability. The pi is basically a computer, and is not reliable to put out a stable and controlled PWM for precision motors.

Maybe it is just a few lines, but not know C++ and not wanting to spend some 30 hours (or more?) to port it myself, i have moved on to using python for the RPi which is not much different since it can't do interrupts anyway.

tshark (with the interface in monitoring mode) also captures probing frames, which is what phones send out every now and then, even if not connected to anything. The phone does have to be activated in some way; when the screen is off, it doesn't do anything; as soon as someone activates the phone, it will start probing. This is why many shops and other venues offer free WiFi. People will use it and, as such, become easier to track in the store / place. With the Pi + a simple WiFi dongle that supports monitoring mode, you can quite easily and affordably create such a setup yourself.

I've been reading about your project and RS-485 now. It seems that RS-485 is designed for daisy chained network topology, but the existing twisted pair cabling (previously used for PT100 sensors) has a star topology. So it seems like this kind of solution might not work very well with that cabling?

GarethS,https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=183736,"Thanks Guys

The unit is 100 miles away so tough to do any physical tests.
However, The camera is infact inside a metal casing, while the USB is outside.

It wasn't clear if the potential CSI noise is RF or electrical - but unless the RF is leaking down the USB cable, then there is already a reasonable amount of screening between camera and WiFi.

What I was looking for, is any software tests I may be able to run remotely.
Remember the behaviour appears to be router dependent, so I know the camera doesn't completely kill the WiFi, but on one network appears to cause enough trouble to stop it working - while it's quite happy on my home network.

I was wondering if there were any low level tests I could run on the WiFi to see if I could get some debug from it that would help narrow down the root cause.

I have some ideas in mind, but am kicking tyres at the moment to see what falls out.
Any help at targeted debug will be appreciated."," Tue Apr 19, 2016 12:35 pm",3,"Thu Mar 24, 2016 8:03 am","RaspiVid kills WiFi"

Photographic filters higher priced?
Edmund glass filters even higher $$$$

By combining two filters you could get narrow band?
With the angle of the view of the lens, very thin filters are better.
With a 60 degree angle the light effectively goes through a filter twice the thickness around the edges.
Which is why the IR filter is normally behind the lens.
This was very noticeable when I used the thin film multi-band filters from Infitec/Dobly 3D glasses.

Anyhow I want my input to be efficient so I'll need many sensors, and the z-wave sensors for this are far too expensive, via arduino I could use cheaper sensors, and in principle the thing I want to do is 'if this happens, then that action happen' principle, which is should be perfect for an Arduino no?

I'll eplain a bit more my case I want to focus on:
With our insulation requirements for the government here in Europe becoming more and more killing for a good architectural design, I want some more freedom, the calculation of heat loss is always based on static data, I was thinking to start a little project to reduce the heat loss in a home through automation.
I would like therefore this applied to my own apartment.
I attached a small example of how the input should look like

For example:
Motion sensor can record the pattern of occupant and we can obtain optimum operation of the heater with these values. The system registers that on a business day the last person leaves the house at 8:30 am every morning, and the first person returns home on Mon / Tue / Thu / Fri at 17h, Wednesday at 16h.

The same principle with humidity sensors and humidity in bathrooms or air quality.

For output then we could get:

The heating can therefore be off 80% of the day, and must be set to x degrees when the first person returns home. Sensor detects that the last person goes to sleep 22h30, so 21h45 the heating may be switched off until morning.

When the last person has left in the morning, the heating shuts off again, and windows may be opened by an automated rod so that fresh air can enter, without the heater still turned on, and therefore no heat is lost.

If somewhere here in the forum or anywhere else has already written such a small project is, do not hesitate to share this moment here with me to let me go start. This is a big issue here in Europe and it would be great if we could find good programmable options to solve these problems.

Top tutorial, took me a couple of goes to get it sorted but works well now!!

Traps to fall into :

First, use the version of Raspbian listed at the start of the tutorial, the later versions will give errors when you try to use the ""pactl"" commands and hang your Pi. Google to get the right one and it will work.

Second, in the initial Pi setup, enable SSH and then use Putty on your PC to copy and paste the commands from the tutorial into the SSH session. This avoids the typo's of doing it yourself, especially that shell script which needs to be formatted perfectly for it to work.

You do need an external amp to get acceptable volume, but it pumps out nicely out of my stereo, via my mobile phone from the couch. Audio quality is just fine, given how it works.

Next step is to try it out in the car, the car stereo has a aux 3.5mm audio input but it's a pain to connect it up with the phone all the time when you are getting in and out. Much easier with a wireless connection, will see how well it auto connects, but it's a great start.

The system should work outdoor for hours, on car battery, but I think I could manage the power supply system. 12V -> 5V DC/DC converter (maybe linear but more likely step-down).
Hardware
- Pis, don't know which model yet.
- usb hubs, powered.
- usb wifi adapter. I need range up to 150m, maybe I need a directionnal antenna ?
- usb sound cards, 8 for each side. I found some 1$ cheap usb sound cards on ebay, is it a trap ? Are there some chipset I have to avoid ? The project is aimed at voice quality, nothing fancy.
I have bought nothing yet, I wanted to have some advice before.
Software
This is the part I have the most difficulties. I have no experience in sound system, multi-card or linux sound. My needs are simple : take the input of one sound card, send it throught the wifi network and play it on another sound card. And the other way back. It will be very static, this sound card will forever be bound to that card. I don't need any display device.
I think I could use Mumble : server on one side, clients on both. I could surely use some script to connect each sound card to the right Mumble channel.
Maybe there is something far more simple, but I'm not aware of.

Is it ""yeah, it should work with some effort"" or ""you must be kidding, this is totally insane"" ?

Before going the route of adding a cooling fan (let alone 6 of them!), type vcgencmd measure_temp into a console whilst pushing your Pi as hard as you're ever likely to push it. Unless it sits very close to 85Â°C, there's nothing to be gained by adding fans.

My Pi2B Mini-PC/Media Centre is fitted with a 40mm 5v case fan under proportional thermal control, but that's only needed because I've overclocked the Pi2B as far as it's possible to go with complete stability whilst playing games like Quake3 Arena that gives the CPU cores and GPU a far harder time than anything else I've ever thrown at them.

This particular Pi2B would undoubtedly self-throttle under these conditions with no fan in warmer weather as it already hits the low 80s when very heavily loaded without one in mid-January, but that in itself is totally harmless. It just causes irritating jumps in gaming framerate as the clocks back off. I doubt I'd even notice it under any other circumstances.

Long story short...

You can learn more about Guzunty here:
https://github.com/Guzunty/Pi/wiki

The new core is not yet linked into the main site, but you can find the resources here:
https://github.com/Guzunty/Pi/tree/master/src/gz_ppm

The programmed hardware reads a ppm stream from a radio receiver and provides an interrupt to the RPi to alert the software that a channel has been decoded. The current value for the channel is then read as a 16 bit word from the SPI interface. The pulse widths are measured in hardware, so there is no latency or other source of inaccuracy. The bit accuracy is as good as the highest resolution from the Turnegy radio linked to above,

It also echoes the ppm stream out as decoded separate PWM signals for each channel, in case you wish to pass any channels out without processing them in the Pi. For outputting processed PWM streams, you can use the Servo Blaster software. Your adafruit servo controller will also work fine for this purpose of course.

I stress that this core is experimental at this time. Please do not buy a Guzunty board expecting this to work out of the box just yet. If you want to be an early adopter and help validate the core, you would be most welcome. If enough people are interested in this core, we can justify buying some radio gear to test against so that we can provide support, so please either add a note to your order indicating you want to use the ppm core or else visit:
https://github.com/Guzunty/Pi/issues/14
and leave a comment indicating your interest (no purchase necessary this way of course ).

As can be seen from the scope images in the issue thread, the core simulates fine, but we are awaiting feedback from a community member as to whether it works with real world receivers.

If you replace that switch with a relay like that the Pi won't know if it is turning the light on or off.

Say the relay is ""off"" then Com (COM) is connected to NO (L1). The light may be on or off, depending on the position of the switch. Change the switch and the light will change - your program won't know that.

All you can do is to get it to toggle the existing state OFF to ON or ON to OFF.

The Pi will never give you real-time with linux (depending on how 'real-time' you need). Arduinos will, but connectivity, memory and processing power are limited. You might be better off with a hybrid solution - reading the sensors with Arduinos and sending the data to a Pi for further analysis.


Actually, there are patches to the linux kernel in order to handle real time applications, like CNC controllers. It would require patching and recompiling the kernel, and probably using a much older kernel; so there would be lots of problems to fight... but it does exist, and I have done it before.

Also, if the rasperry PI 2 with 4 cores it the device in use; there is the possibility of dedicating a single core entirely to reading a sensor; eg: detach it from linux, and run a single assembly language program on it.

The hybrid solution with a microcontroller is probably the easiest/best. There are also simple TI MSP430 processors which compete with adruinos. Simple ones sell for around U.S. 60 cents to $1.20 each; They are 16 bit processors, and ultra low power. Those often have SPI buses implemented in hardware, depending on which one you choose. So, interfacing to the PI is almost trivial.

The last time I checked, TI was preparing to release a solder RF module that allows the MSP 430 to do full .80211B and maybe G.
That's about the fastest wireless you are going to get...

There are also BlueTooth wireless USART modules from china (eg: Like RS232C signals but only 0V to +3.3 or +5V levels). They are normally sold for Adruino, but they work with TI MSP430 just fine, too. I just bought two of them to interface to a parallax controller for CNC work. Those modules sell for around $4 to $6 from China (post paid) on ebay.

Note: my MSP programmer (USB dongle) ] does work on linux. The development software is just GNU GCC. eg: Software can even be developed on the PI itself, and windows is not required. If you're on a super budget, and just experimenting ... there are also people like me who don't mind programming a few of our spare chips and sending them to people as long as the postage isn't excessive."," Wed Feb 24, 2016 2:06 pm",14,"Mon Feb 22, 2016 11:23 pm","getting two Pis to dump sensor readings into "

Herbs,https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=24410,"Hello!

Hereâ€™s how I get an alert on my iPhone or iPad when my front door is opened, all from the Raspberry Pi. This is useful when Iâ€™m away as a sort of remote burglar alarm (I can then phone my neighbours to check on the house), but you could use the alerting part of this project to send whatever you like.

Here is how to do it:

1) Build a basic switch input circuit and install GPIO libraries to read it from Python

I used the excellent instructions in The MagPi magazine, Issue 2, but removed the LED and 470 Ohm resistor. I wonâ€™t recreate the instructions here - follow the guide in the magazine to setup the software and create the circuit and you should be fine.

http://www.themagpi.com/

2) Rather than a normal switch, connect a reed switch to this circuit

Reed switches contain a very thin piece of metal. When a magnet is in close proximity the switch is either open or closed. When it is moved, it flips to the opposite state (the magnet literally pulls the piece of metal to make or break contact). Mount the switch on your door frame and the magnet on the actual door right next to it. The switch will now change state when the door is opened.

3) Setup a means to receive alerts on your iPhone/iPad

Download the Prowl application:

http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/prowl-growl-client/id320876271?mt=8

Now register your account, login, and set up an API key. This will be used as the ID for the application to receive messages. We will send a Prowl message from the Raspberry Pi through an API in Python and your Prowl account/application will take care of getting the actual alerts onto your iThing.

4) Setup a means to send Prowl messages from your Raspberry Pi

Install Python setup tools if you have not done so already:

CODE: SELECT ALL
sudo apt-get install python-setuptools


Download Pyrowl, a Python prowl interface:

https://github.com/babs/pyrowl/

Put the files into a suitable directory and change to it. Now install Pyrowl:

CODE: SELECT ALL
sudo python setup.py install


5) Write the code

Check out the test.py program that comes with Pyrowl and then write some code to send an alert. This is done by referring to the API key you set up earlier. Below is a basic test that I wrote. Possibly not the best coding, but hey it does a job of illustrating how this looks. Note you will need to supply your own API key and check the GPIO pin number being used matches where you plugged your circuit in.

You may also want to change the code to not to send an alert if one has been recently sent (e.g. someone opening and closing the door repeatedly), or otherwise limit the alerts to not annoy you too much (Prowl itself does have a timed limit but itâ€™s quite high). However you decide to code it up, I suggest first writing a version that prints out the alerts, and only once tested do you revert this to actually using the Pyrowl API to send them.

CODE: SELECT ALL
#!/bin/usr/bin/python

# Imports for Pyrowl
from pyrowl import Pyrowl
from pprint import pprint
import os

# Imports for GPIO
import time
import RPi.GPIO as GPIO

# Setup pyrowl with API key
p = None
p = Pyrowl(""ENTER YOUR API KEY HERE!"")

# Setup GPIO pin as input
# Check that this is the same pin you have your switch input plugged into!
GPIO.setup(11, GPIO.IN)


# Set initial state
previousstate = GPIO.input(11)

# Main loop
while True:
# Check that this is the same pin you have your switch input plugged into!
mybutton = GPIO.input(11)
if mybutton != previousstate:
if mybutton == True:
print ""Door opened""
res = p.push(""My Raspberry Pi"", 'House Warning', 'Door opened', batch_mode=False)
else:
print ""Door closed""
res = p.push(""My Raspberry Pi"", 'House Warning', 'Door closed', batch_mode=False)

previousstate = mybutton
# Print result if you like               
#pprint(res)
time.sleep(.2)


So, now you should be able send alerts from your RPi to your iPhone/iPad, and maybe catch burglars. You could always combine this with a photo emailed from a webcam, an audible warning through some mini speakers, etc. Or use it to alert you to pretty much anything.

Iâ€™d be interested to know if anyone else tries this/a variation and of course, if you have success. I didnâ€™t have a lot of time to write this up so if you see anything that needs editing please let me know.

If you could hook up the doorbell button to the input side of this board and the 3.3V of the Rpi, via the (output side) of the relay to GPIO7 you could detect something.

What I want to do next is to be able to connect one or more Arduinos to my system. The purpose of these Arduinos is to act as ""slaves"" for Pi. They would wait for command from Pi and depending from the command they would put certain lights on or read analog data from some sensors and send it back to Pi for processing. Pi would not have anything connected to its pins anymore.

When I started to connect these ""slave"" Arduinos everything worked great EXCEPT: when my scheduled task on Pi runs every minute, it always resets all Arduinos when it connects to them via USB-cable. This means, of course, that I loose the current state of the pins on every Arduino every minute when the task runs.

I'd do it with a mostly static web page containing a bit of AJAX to periodically fetch the sensor readings from a CGI program on the Pi.

mini-httpd works well as the web server. Type ""apt-get install mini-httpd"" to install it. You'll need to configure it too, but it's not too hard.

A CGI is just a program, anything it outputs to the console will be sent via the web server to the browser, you can write it in any language you like. Just output something like 20,open. This makes it dead easy to test this part of the system, just run it from a shell prompt. You can also just type the URL of it in the address bar of the browser to check the data gets sent over correctly.

The AJAX is just javascript to fetch data from the web server. It uses a XMLHttpRequest to fetch data in the background. Make your life easy to begin with, and stick the javascript in the header of the page. Don't bother with XML encoding the data will be available in the responseText. When the data comes back, it calls another javascript function to handle it. That function can put the data onto the page. I'd have a HTML div element with an ID set for each value and use getelementbyid to be able to set it's innerhtml to the text you want to display.

If you decide to make graphs of the data, check out RRDTool.

hrvoje,https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=181316,"Hi,


Recently I started a project where I needed to read 2-bit rotary encoder switch. I got rotary encoders from SunFounder with pull-ups & push button and started searching for simple code that would give me direction and number of steps turned. Simplest example would be volume control.

And here is where complications started. Each and every code and example I found relied on interpreting bit pairs (0:0, 1:0, 0:1, 1:1) encoder produced while being turned. While all of that works in theory in praxis all of them suffered various problems due to real world: bouncing contacts, skipped or wrong readings, .... So most of the code tried to somehow come around those problems by guessing missed steps, filtering obviously wrong inputs and so on. In other words all of them (at least the ones I found) where imperfect or complicated.

Solution to all of above is really simple, one had to look at the problem from another angle:

Working principle of 2-bit rotary encoder switch is that states of lines (A and B) MUST change at different point of time as seen in picture. Otherwise it would be impossible to read the direction of turning!



Each single step of encoder produces 4 state pairs but ultimately it ends with (1:1), and in this lies the solution:

Instead of trying to read and match states and calculate direction, solution is dead simple: IGNORE all changes before final state (1:1) and, using interrupts, determine which edge came first before reaching (1:1) - A or B. And this will give you direction of turning. Added bonus is that you don't need any hardware debouncing as it is included in code itself.
No steps are missed. No steps are misinterpreted!

In attached example I simulated volume knob. Depending on speed with which the knob is turned volume is increased/decreased as square function of speed. Rotary encoder is connected to GPIO pins 4 & 14 and interrupts are used.

Main loop checks every 100 msec if volume has been turned, and if so it adjusts Volume variable. Added complication in this example is that if you leave the code running for VERY LONG time and turn the knob always in one direction variable in which number of changes is held will wrap around to zero when ti reaches MAX or MIN integer value! To avoid it you have to reset it to 0 and in doing so watch out for simultaneous access from interrupt thread. I used simple locking for that.

Here is the code in Python, rewriting it in any other language should be simple:

CODE: SELECT ALL

I love the relay concept and use it all the time for internal control and activation of pretty much anything electronic. The thing is, home automation and this project is about more than simply controlling the panel with an app and getting email notification. That is already common place in the alarm industry with a $100 module and a $10 app. Unless of course you are one of the unfortunate souls with a DSC (dealers second choice, now owned by Tyco which you can see as a toy company who will try to Take Your Company Over) or the equally aweful piece of crap Honeywell/Ademco with their ancient pcb and uber slow combus (which they only recently began to acknowledge)

I know I'm biased towards paradox, after all the head honcho, shmuel, has always been very approachable, there are also several other manufacturors who make awesome panels with various levels of relay functionality. Apex out of one of the Carolina's was one of them, but Honeywell bought them out and butchered them for their parts. Apparently it was too expensive to make a fully functional automation panel in the USA. Sad really.

Now onto what else can be done. With individual zone or zone group notification you can activate low voltage led lighting (just tear apart those stupid line voltage led bulbs and yank out the power supply which is prone to burning out, recycle the aluminum heat sink (don't need it at 12vdc.org) and you now have a bright azzed 12 VDC light source controllable with a simple relay. Thinner guage wire needed as well so for those building, you can save money on that new galvanic oxidation prone crap copper steel alloy china is churning out like bad diarrhea. Ever wonder why yellow wire insulation now turns black once power is run through it!? Copper and steel separate. But I could go on for hours about crap made in China.

Other things you can do is trigger music, maybe flag a room in a vacation home as occupied so the heat does not run unnecisarrily if that family member isn't there.

No more cold feet while taking a dump at 3 am or staggering for a light switch. Hell, you can even flush a toilet if you want.

As for motion detectors and false tendencies. Ya they can be a pain, but when properly installed considering all sources of random IR.... See the false alarms article at http://www.keepsafesystems.ca
There are many other activity/ occupancy detection methods including resistive piezo floor flex / stress sensors. Awesome little devices available at www.alarmparts.ca use those to detect when you walk in and out of a room or when you sit down for a comfortable poop. Why walk up stairs in the dark or pee on the toilet seat when your home is automated. The possibilities are endless.
In the more complex environments, you can also use ""smart"" IP camera's such as the Linux based, made in Germany, Mobotix IP ""kamerrra"" also available at www.keepsafesystems.ca for those in Canada (Mobotix AMP - highest level of integrator for Mobotix, also the Best pricing available) or www.alarmparts.ca again. I may be on abit of a rant on the Mobotix product line as I recently had a chat with Dr. Hinkel, the inventor of the Mobotix 360 degree camera. Amazing man, as a hobby he runs a farm on some of the land he owns in south central Germany. Very down to earth intelligent guy with some amazing ideas and a stickler for detail. Like all krau... I mean us Germans
With the Mobotix you can do trip lines, direction of motion, object counting and more. For more info on Mobotix, check out www.mobotixtech.com.

I could go on for hours on the advantage of single device per zone and the options within home automation but I'm sure that would bore most of you. If the topic doesn't bore the crap out of you (in which case do not worry about cold feet while purging ) drop me a quick note at my project page at www.LoxOne.org (apparently some Austrians are now ticked off at me, lots of lawyers have visited my site trying to take the project down... Sad really) oh well, as long as everyone knows it is a big coincidence and LoxOne has nothing to do with a particular Austrian manufacturer.

Has anyone tried utilyte fitPC? Alarmparts.ca distributes that. The guys at pi have sadly turned us down pi is an awesome product though and far more affordable than many others. Plus, not made in China sadly not Germany, but not China which is what matters most in quality control.

When turned on it would move towards the limit switch, and then it would know where both limits are. A rotary sensor wouldn't know where rudder is at when powered up, just detecting when it moves.

you're right but that's why i want to use a rudder position sensor since they are simple to install and they do know what the position of the rudder is at all time.

this is just an example.

Feedback on joystick would require making your own. there are a couple that have it, if you want to spend $300+ dollars.
But for marine environment, consider bluetooth so you can SEAL the controller and the rudder, water especially salt water are not your friend. If all you want is rudder, arduino would be a cheaper bet for WHEN it gets wet. A touch screen would be batter able to be sealed, then just drag finger across it to turn.

i've gotten the joystick already and asked at the grovepi forums about this and it should work but i'm about to test this system with an arduino first since it got analog inputs already.
the Raspi including the touchscreen are going to be mounted on a console fully sealed so no water could reach them even fresh water is a nightmare and when salt or fresh water are on the screen then could these only reacts as ""touches"" on the screen which is quite hopeless.
the point of the touchscreen is because i wanted some ""Digital Switching"" on my boat ( its only 5M long lol) so when i want some navigation lights turned on i just press on the button right on the screen and it would be turned on ^^

So are you planning on controlling the boat to water ski by yourself?

well not really hehe i've gotten an 7,5 HP outboard engine on this boat and the size of this boat are quite ideal for sailing through cities including their small canals really TROUGH the cities. but long trips are also done so thats why started this ^^.

Doesn't that violate like 27 different laws?

well here you need to take care about a couple of rules/laws
1. you need sight on the person who is Skiing
2. for fast ships you need a Deadman cord for when you fall out of the boat then the engine turn itself off
3. ofcourse a sailing license
4. Fire fighting equipment
5. Registry number on the boat

but in this case YOU are the skiing person so rule 1 is done for 2 we need a Deadman's cord on the remote console ^^
3 needs to be onboard 4 also 5 also

IanH,https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=5148,"I've just had a quick look at the manual, and it looks like you can control it over a serial interface ('simplified serial' or 'packetised serial' will do; you won't need the 'slave select' option if you have just one of them).

The Pi has a serial port available on the GPIO header, described in detail at:
http://elinux.org/Rpi_Low-level_peripherals

You'll need to wire the TxD pin (GPIO 14) to the controller. Now the Pi has a 3.3V output, and the controller says it needs 5V 'TTL' levels, but that's probably OK - most 5V inputs actually work perfectly well driven off 3.3V.

By default the serial port gets used as a Unix console, which will get in the way of using it for your program. Handy instructions about fixing this are at:

I designed a new 3D printed Robot due to my disapointment with other 3D printable Pi Robots. Used Tinkercad which is actually really cool (and easy to use)!

Its designed to house the Raspberry Pi Model A+ or Zero, two 28BYJ-48 Stepper Motors with ULN2003 Drivers and a hr-sc04 or hy-srf05 ultrasonic distance sensor (srf05 recommended). Its powered by a cheap USB power bank (the ones that hold a single 18650 battery) that sits on top. The ring on the top can have a neopixel ring taped under it!

These components can all be purchased very cheaply on ebay even shipped from the UK - Â£2 for the distance sensor,Â£2.50 for the battery, Â£3.50 for a motor and driver. And perhaps half that shipped from China.

You can connect it all up with dupoint cable, no need for soldering! Instructions on the thingiverse page but its all pretty simple wiring.

So although I could not find a definite solution, I found a quick fix and the reason as to this error on both parts.

First off, setting alsa config files to default to a card basically works as a variable so when I set it card 0, my audio card was defualt and I could simply put in the command aplay and run it. However I would have to do arecord -D hw1,0 to record through the mic.

Second, asound.conf and asoundrc are the same thing essentially, so it doesn't matter which one you write to, and they can be left empty.

Thirdly, for Jasper, that long error before running jasper was a problem with the modprobe bcm2835, downloading it and messing with its config is a big NO NO for anyone who wants to mess with jasper. As that is what led to my error. I did a little research on how to fix this but no definite answers that could fix jaspers mess.

Fourthly, this all happened because I was trying to make jasper display sound through his 3.5mm jack instead of the monitor. To do this type in
amixer controls
IF you have 3 settings like mic capture mic volume and mic gain, DO NOT TOUCH THEM, they are not what your looking for. Instead try doing this
amixer -c 0 controls or amixer -c 1 controls
keep changing the value after -c if you have multiple audio out/inputs till you find PCM Playback route, or something close to that, then type in
amixer -c N cset numid=3 1
where N is the correct number for your audio output card, the value after the three sets the audio output to the audio jack. If this doesn't work try going through raspi-config, and /boot/config.txt but stay away from configuring alsa and bcm unless you know what your doing.

How I fixed it: I re-imaged an SD card and saved all the files that I had on the previous jasper sd card onto my desktop computer. Took me like 10 minutes, and I got a valuable lesson out of it. I hope this helps others out!"," Sat Feb 14, 2015 7:03 pm",8,"Sat Feb 14, 2015 4:34 pm","Jasper: Invalid Sample Rate -9997"

James75,https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=112648,"Thanks B.Goode !! I checked out the Jelly Baby resource here on the Raspberry Pi site and it was really useful. I have now got the audio part of my project sorted and have set up 3 buttons connected to GPIO pins 23, 24 and 25 which when pressed each play a different selection of clips from the Star Wars films.

Here is the code for the wav.file player:

import time
import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
import os

GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)
GPIO.setwarnings(False)
GPIO.setup(23, GPIO.IN)
GPIO.setup(24, GPIO.IN)
GPIO.setup(25, GPIO.IN)

sounds = ['TIE_Attack5.wav', 'Fanfair.wav']

print sounds[0]
print sounds[1]
s1_count = 0
mf_count = 0


while True:

if GPIO.input(23) == False:
os.system(""omxplayer -o local %s"" % sounds[s1_count])
time.sleep(1)
s1_count += 1
if s1_count == 2:
s1_count = 0

if GPIO.input(24) == False:
os.system(""omxplayer -o local %s"" % sounds[mf_count])
time.sleep(1)
mf_count += 1
if mf_count == 2:
mf_count = 0


if GPIO.input(25) == False:
os.system(""omxplayer -o local TIE_Attack5.wav"")
time.sleep(1)

I have only used a couple of wav.files but it works great, and I will add more files to the lists at the top which will allow me to trigger a whole range of audio from the various buttons.

I have started the next part of the project, which is to hook up some Neopixels that will be triggered at the same time as the audio via the input from the same GPIO pin, however I have run into a problem and really hoping someone on here has had a similar experience, or I may just be making a school boy error.

I have followed this page http://frederickvandenbosch.be/?p=1014 and have successfully run the strandtest.py file on a ring of 12 Neopixels. The problems come when I intergrate the 2 circuits. Like I said I have 3 buttons connected to GPIO pins 23-25, and the data pin for the Neopixels is on GPIO 18 as this pin uses PWM which is required for the Neopixels.

I have not yet combined the code so that audio and LEDs are triggered at the same time due to the following happening.

I can run the audio program fine, press all the 3 buttons and trigger all the audio files. I can then run the strandtest.py file and again, all is fine. If I then run the audio program, the LED's light up in a random pattern, which is kind of in time to the audio being played so clearly a signal of some kind is being output from PIN 18 but it wasn't the first time that the audio program was run. Then if I go back and run the strandtest.py program if just does random sequences and not the functions that are contained within the program and at the same time interference is coming through the speakers. If I then try and run the audio program again, it runs with no errors but no audio is output. The only way to get things working after this point is to reboot the Pi !

Am I doing something fundamentally wrong by having Neopixels hooked up to GPIO 18 whilst have GPIO 23-25 tset up as inputs for button presses, is there some way whether it's hardware or software changes that can prevent this interference from occurring ? I am using a Raspberry Pi B+ as some sources say that the Neopixels won't work on the Rapsberry 2 yet, although I do have a 2 if anyone suggests trying it on there !!! I initially had the ground for the Neopixels and the GPIO audio trigger buttons are all connected up together which I thought could be causing the problem, but I still get the same results when I use separate ground pins.

The end result I am working towards is have a single button press to simultaneously trigger the playing of a WAV. file and a predefined Neopixel sequence.

Many many thanks to anyone who takes the time to respond !!!

At the bottom is the Neopixel code that I am running in Python.

I would like a water resistant formable material for my case so that it can fit tightly around the device and be small enough to be pocketable. Ideally it should be thermally conductive also because I may be running into overheating problems already.

These are the only options I have so far:
1. Wrap the device carefully with electrical tape. This works better than it sounds but doesn't look so good, would make it hard to market if I decided to do that, and most importantly leads to overheating because the tape traps heat.
2. 3D scanner combined with 3D printer for a custom tight fit case. 3D printers are getting very affordable but maybe not the 3d scanners. I also would prefer to stay with a homemade touch rather than use industrial techniques.
3. Carefully modify an existing project box to fit snugly. This is actually extremely hard to do with just a dremel tool and does not scale at all. Also project boxes I have seen have low quality plastic that requires the walls to be ""thick"" compared to the thin but strong and flexible plastic that established electronics manufacturers use.

But telling us more about the device would probably get you more useful answers.



Hi,

Thanks for your reply!

The device I'm using is USB-SSR Series (Digital Devices for Solid State I/O Modules). This device manufactured by measurement computing. Please let me know any information needed.

Yes you can do with with the app 'as is'. What you would need to do is change the PHP code in your GPIO.php file to use an IF statement in your PHP script, that executes the Wiring Pi command to control those pins when something like IF $_GET['pin'] = 1 then command X e.g.

$output = shell_exec('gpio mode 7 out');
$output = shell_exec('gpio write 7 '.$_GET['status']);

and IF $_GET['pin']=2 then command Y e.g.

$output = shell_exec('gpio mode 8 out');
$output = shell_exec('gpio write 8 '.$_GET['status']);

etc.

I can't write this for you at the moment as I don't have time right now so you may need to research the correct syntax for a PHP IF Statement, but it's entirely possible to do this as it is now.

4. You have a dastardly isp who have decided to use double natting (sometimes known as carrier grade nat) where they allocate you an ip address that is NOT accessible from the internet. The ip address allocated is one of the private non-routable addresses, such as 192.168.123.456 They then aggregate users and only allocate external, internet-routable addresses at a concentration point on their system.

This situation means that you cannot use a 3rd party dynamic dns provider to give you an externally accessible ip address.

I'm in a similar boat: my Pi's are connected via a wireless internet provider that uses double nat. I'm located 150 miles away from the Pi's and need to access them remotely.

In my case, I already ""lease"" a web server with a static IPv4/IPv6 address for around $5/month since I have a few websites. My Pi's open reverse ssh tunnels to my web sever and keep them open; each uses a unique port# (e.g. 10001, 10002, ...). I use 'autossh' to make sure that the tunnels get re-established in case the ssh process dies; and also created a 'systemd' service to make sure the 'autossh' process gets restarted in case it dies.

When I need to connect to a remote Pi, I open a ssh tunnel from my local Linux machine to the web server, which essentially ""connects"" the two ssh tunnels together.

Here is a rough example for Pi #1 which uses port 10001:

A remote Pi opens a reverse ssh tunnel to my web server (pitunnel@blahblah): this is established 24/7.

$ ssh -N -T -R 10001:localhost:22 -o ExitOnForwardFailure=yes -o ServerAliveInterval=300 -o ServerAliveCountMax=2 -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o BatchMode=yes -i /home/pi/.ssh/id_rsa pitunnel@blahblah

Then from my local Linux box when I need to access the Pi above:

// Establish a tunnel to the web server with local port forwarding (pitunnel@blahblah) for Pi #1:
$ ssh -f -N -T -L 10001:localhost:10001 -o ServerAliveInterval=60 -o ServerAliveCountMax=3 -o ""StrictHostKeyChecking=no"" pitunnel@blahblah

// Connect to the remote pi:
$ ssh -p 10001 pi@localhost
$ sftp -P 10001 pi@localhost

Currently i am working on a voice application for the raspberry pi. It is very important that the audio delay is as low as possible.

I'm using pulseaudio and gstreamer for this because pulseaudio includes some echocancellers, and these echo cancellers are mandatory for the voice application i am working on.

When using gstreamer and alsa, i get an acceptable delay of say 200 ms. I test this by connecting a USB microphone to the pi and sending the audio output of the microphone dierctly to the analog output (speaker output). The gstreamer commands are:

gst-launch-1.0 alsasrc device=plughw:camera ! alsasink sync=false

As mentioned earlier, the delay using alsa only is very acceptable. Next try is the same topology, but using pulseaudio.

gst-launch-1.0 pulsesrc ! pulsesink sync=false

Now, i have a delay of about one second, which way to high!
When googling for this problem, i found this page (https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/PulseAudio/Documentation/Developer/Clients/LatencyControl/ ) were some tips are given to reduce the latency when using pulseaudio. I have implemented these tips by building gstreamer from source and modified pulssrc.c and pulsesink.c according to the documentation, but no improvement.

Can anyone give a hint about reducing the latency when using pulseaudio on raspberry pi. Help is greatly appriciated.

I wrote a Linux kernel driver for the HC-SRO4 ultrasonic distance sensor. It allows precise measurements of the distance independent of CPU load. Amongst other features are:

*) Supports n (more than one) HC-SRO4 devices
*) run-time configureable via sysfs
*) Proper locking (when device is in use others will get EBUSY)
*) Uses interrupts, so no (or minimal) CPU load
*) Busy loop (no sleep) doing measurements works since the driver does the necessary sleep itself.

If you place the microphone and speaker 1 cm apart* for example you get 0.3 ms to do the processing. Though that does sound a little optimistic, I am guessing by the time you have the signal go through a sound card, get processed, and be played through the speaker you are at a fair few ms.

For x28 alarms, you can activate/deactivate by sending (-) to ""beep"" terminal using the relay switch.
For turning on/off conditioning air, you should wire and parallell solder relay switch to the AC board on/off switch

It might help to use rule-based proxy-switching extensions for chrome like this one: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/proxy-switchy/caehdcpeofiiigpdhbabniblemipncjj. Still you'd need a second proxy for switching between UK and US - or at least a remotely triggerable script for switching the pi's vpn connection.

I will have a look into that.

rc522(function(rfidSerialNumber){

Only trouble was setting up gmail. ""email_alarm_target"" was a bit tricky and payload was not readable by python. I changed payload part to read the header instead. Maybe issue with different python version or something.

To newbies like me a set up tutorial could be written to explain how to set up postgres and explain how to test email commands.

Trying to get some input on how to go about this project. It might be more programming oriented but theres plenty of hardware that needs to all get put together.

At work we have a gigantic 10x20' autoclave that we have a heater controller but with manual pressure control via ball valves. We have a smaller 5x10' autoclave that have full heater and pressure control. I want to basically replicate the controller on the small autoclave using a raspberry pi.

I'm thinking about getting a Pi 3 (I have an original Pi B+ too) for the built in wifi so this can be controlled remotely and also send out email alerts. Also thinking about using this ADC board https://www.abelectronics.co.uk/p/56/AD ... -converter.

So basically the Pi would need to poll temperature and ramp it up according to the profile and hold the temp for the step duration. Simultaneously it would need to poll pressure and fill/hold/dump according to the profile as well. I think these two backend functions would be pretty easy to accomplish since they are simply polling functions.

Now the harder part for me is to design a front end system. I would like to run apache on the Pi and make the front end web-based so we could access the controller when we are away or know when to run back to the shop when doing runs after hours. The ADC board comes with python and C libraries and trying to decide which will be easier. I have a CS degree and learned C++ but never python (either way, my C is very rusty). Would python do the trick and be able to make a web based front end while doing the backend perfectly?

Some later functions:
Ability to detect vacuum leaks and shut off leaking line
Email/SMS alerts of warnings, cycle completion etc.
Logging
Manual controls.

Some basics:
ADC inputs:
Temperature (room temp to 300F)
Pressure (atmosphere to 60psi)
Main Vacuum
Vacuum lines 1-5

Output switches
Heater on/off
fan on/off
Pressure fill
Pressure dump

But, in the other way, i really wanna find a way to simply plug the vita cable into a ""converter"" with Dupont cables. (simpliest solder after to the teensy).

BTW, I'm referring to the PIC32 DMA.

Are you referring to the communication protocol or the hardware interface?

If hardware, it is just a normal SPI interface; 1 clk, 2 data bus and a chip select. The chip select is omitted on the smaller board (PICnc Jr) due to lack of pins. The uart is used for firmware upgrades and a set of i/o is used for handshaking.

There is no formal communication protocol yet as everything is still in a state of flux. The SPI sends and receives data at the same time and the system is configured to transfer 64 bytes at one go (this is the max RPi buffer size). This is done every 1ms. Currently only position commands and position feedback are being transferred.
